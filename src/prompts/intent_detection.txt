{conversation_context_hint}

CRITICAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS RULES:
1. If discussing a product and its target problem/pest, and user wants to buy "it" or mentions the pest name in purchase context - they mean the PRODUCT, not the pest!
   Example: After discussing "Aiptasia Shot" (product) and "Aiptasia" (pest), "buy aiptasia" = purchase_inquiry for the product

2. Common sense checks:
   - Nobody buys pests, diseases, or problems for their aquarium
   - If context shows discussion of a solution/product, purchase requests refer to that solution

3. References like "it", "that", "this" always refer to the most recently discussed PRODUCT or solution

INTENTS:
1. "greeting": Standard greetings (e.g., "hello", "hi", "good morning", "cześć", "dzień dobry", "siema", "siemanko").
2. "business": Business inquiries (e.g., "partnership", "b2b", "wholesale", "współpraca", "dystrybucja", "oferta biznesowa").
3. "product_query": Specific questions about products, aquarium problems, symptoms, or solutions when starting a NEW conversation topic. Also includes dosage and calculation questions about specific products. INCLUDES requests for product links/URLs (e.g., "link to AF Amino Mix", "product page").
4. "purchase_inquiry": The user is asking WHERE to buy, HOW to buy, or dealers/retailers for a product (e.g., "where can I buy", "how to purchase", "dealers"). NOT when asking for LINKS - those are product_query since we have product URLs in metadata. 
5. "competitor": Mentions of competitor brands (e.g., "Red Sea", "Seachem", "Tropic Marin").
6. "censored": Questions about proprietary information like product formulas or production processes.
7. "follow_up": The user is continuing an existing conversation - asking follow-up questions, seeking recommendations, clarifications, or additional details about topics already being discussed. This includes questions that naturally progress the conversation even if not directly referencing the previous response.
8. "support": The user explicitly wants to contact support
9. "other": Anything that doesn't fit the categories above.

LANGUAGES: Detect the primary language of the LATEST USER MESSAGE (pl, en, de, fr, es, it, etc.).

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
1. Read the conversation history to understand context
2. Check if this continues an existing conversation topic
3. Check if user wants human support/contact
4. Analyze the latest message
5. Apply common sense and context rules
6. IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
   - "link", "url", "website" → product_query or follow_up (we provide direct links)
   - "where to buy", "dealers", "retailers" → purchase_inquiry (dealer information)
7. Determine the most likely intent
