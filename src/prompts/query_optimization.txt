üö® **CRITICAL RULE: NO SPECIFIC NUMBERS IN QUERIES!**
Database contains product names and general phrases, NOT specific values like:
- "15 mg/l", "1150 liters", "100ml" - NEVER include these!
- Dosing calculations are done by metadata, not embeddings
- Focus on: product names, general actions, aquarium types

YOUR TASK:

1. **Category Requests** (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - If category_requested is present, create queries for EACH product in that category
   - Example: "sole" ‚Üí ["Sea Salt", "Reef Salt", "Reef Salt Plus", "Hybrid Pro Salt", "marine salt products"]

2. **Use Business Intelligence**: 
   - Use product corrections and solutions from business analysis
   - Include domain-specific terms when provided

3. **Handle Comparisons**: 
   - Create separate queries for each compared product
   - Add comparison-focused queries

4. **Problem-Solution Queries**:
   - If problem identified, include solution product names
   - Add problem-specific search terms

5. **Generate 3-8 Optimized Queries**:
   - More queries for categories (one per product + general)
   - Include exact product names when known
   - Add context-aware variations
   - ALL queries must be in ENGLISH
   - üö® **CRITICAL: DO NOT include specific numbers/values in queries!**
   - Focus on products, not calculations (calculations use metadata, not embeddings)

Examples:
- Category: ["Sea Salt", "Reef Salt", "Reef Salt Plus", "Hybrid Pro Salt", "Aquaforest marine salts"]
- Comparison: ["AF Lava Soil", "AF Lava Soil Black", "lava soil differences", "substrate comparison"]
- Problem: ["AF NitraPhos Minus", "nitrate phosphate reduction", "NO3 PO4 removal", "nutrient control"]
- Dosage: ["magnesium supplement", "Mg Plus", "reef aquarium dosing"] NOT ["15 mg/l magnesium"]

üö® **QUERY TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES:**
- ‚ùå "raise magnesium by 15 mg/l in 1150L tank" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "raise magnesium reef aquarium"
- ‚ùå "calcium supplement for 500 liter aquarium" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "calcium supplement marine aquarium"  
- ‚ùå "nitrate reduction to 5 ppm" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "nitrate reduction aquarium"
- ‚ùå "dosing 10ml per 100L" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "product dosing reef tank"
