üéØ **GUARANTEED PRODUCTS** (will be found automatically via metadata):
{guaranteed_products}
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT create redundant queries for guaranteed products!
Instead of "AF NitraPhos Minus for algae control" ‚Üí use "algae control aquarium"
Instead of "Zeo Mix zeolite media" ‚Üí use "zeolite filtration benefits"

{comparison_instructions}

üö® **CRITICAL RULE: NO SPECIFIC NUMBERS IN QUERIES!**
Database contains product names and general phrases, NOT specific values like:
- "15 mg/l", "1150 liters", "100ml" - NEVER include these!
- Dosing calculations are done by metadata, not embeddings
- Focus on: product names, general actions, aquarium types

YOUR TASK:

1. **Category Requests** (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - If category_requested is present, create queries for EACH product in that category
   - Example: "salts" ‚Üí ["Sea Salt", "Reef Salt", "Reef Salt Plus", "Hybrid Pro Salt", "marine salt products"]

2. **Use Business Intelligence**: 
   - Use product corrections and solutions from business analysis
   - Include domain-specific terms when provided

3. **Handle Comparisons**: 
   - Create separate queries for each compared product
   - Add comparison-focused queries

4. **üÜï SMART PROBLEM-SOLUTION QUERIES**:
   - If guaranteed products are listed, focus on PROBLEM-BASED queries, not product-specific ones
   - Example: If "AF NitraPhos Minus" is guaranteed ‚Üí create "nitrate reduction methods", "algae control strategies"
   - Example: If "Zeo Mix" is guaranteed ‚Üí create "zeolite benefits aquarium", "ULNS system setup"
   - Create queries that find COMPLEMENTARY products and knowledge articles

5. **User-Mentioned Products** (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - If user mentions specific products, create queries for those exact products
   - Example: User says "Zeo Mix" ‚Üí include "Zeo Mix" as a query

6. **Generate 4-10 Optimized Queries**:
   - More queries for categories (one per product + general)
   - Include exact product names when known (but avoid redundancy with guaranteed products)
   - Add context-aware variations focusing on PROBLEMS and METHODS
   - Include educational/knowledge queries when products are guaranteed
   - ALL queries must be in ENGLISH
   - üö® **CRITICAL: DO NOT include specific numbers/values in queries!**
   - Focus on problems, methods, and complementary solutions

üÜï **SMART QUERY EXAMPLES**:
- Guaranteed: ["AF NitraPhos Minus"] ‚Üí Queries: ["nitrate reduction methods", "algae prevention strategies", "probiotic bacteria benefits", "nutrient control reef tank"]
- Guaranteed: ["Zeo Mix", "Pro Bio S"] ‚Üí Queries: ["zeolite filtration benefits", "ULNS system guide", "beneficial bacteria aquarium", "ultra low nutrient methods"]
- Guaranteed: ["Ca Plus"] ‚Üí Queries: ["calcium importance reef tank", "coral calcification support", "calcium deficiency symptoms", "reef chemistry balance"]

üö® **AVOID REDUNDANT QUERIES:**
- ‚ùå "AF NitraPhos Minus for algae" (product guaranteed) ‚Üí ‚úÖ "algae control methods"
- ‚ùå "Zeo Mix zeolite media" (product guaranteed) ‚Üí ‚úÖ "zeolite filtration benefits"
- ‚ùå "Pro Bio S bacteria supplement" (product guaranteed) ‚Üí ‚úÖ "beneficial bacteria importance"
