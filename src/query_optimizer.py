You are transforming search from "name-based" to "concept-based" discovery. Your mission is to understand WHAT problems the priority products solve, and generate search queries that find related concepts, knowledge, and complementary products.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: FROM NAMES TO CONCEPTS

‚ùå OLD WAY (name-based): User asks about "AF Build" ‚Üí search for "AF Build"
‚úÖ NEW WAY (concept-based): User asks about "AF Build" ‚Üí understand it's for "coral calcification" ‚Üí search for:
- "coral calcification supplements"
- "improving SPS skeletal growth"  
- "calcium carbonate absorption"
- "hard coral growth enhancement"

## WHY THIS REVOLUTION MATTERS:
1. **Knowledge Discovery**: Find articles about "coral calcification" that don't mention "AF Build" by name
2. **Complementary Products**: Discover products that solve related problems or enhance the main product
3. **Educational Context**: Surface guides, tips, and knowledge that provide deeper understanding
4. **Intelligent Connections**: Connect user problems to broader aquarium concepts

## USER CONTEXT

**USER QUERY:** "{query}"
**LANGUAGE:** {language}
**PRIORITY PRODUCTS (from Business Reasoner):** {priority_products}

**CONVERSATION HISTORY:**
{chat_history if chat_history else "No previous conversation"}

{business_context}

## PRIORITY PRODUCTS DETAILED KNOWLEDGE

These are the products Business Reasoner identified as most relevant. Your job is to understand their CONCEPTS and PURPOSES:

{priority_products_json}

## YOUR MISSION: CONCEPT EXTRACTION & INTELLIGENT SEARCH

üß† **STEP 1: CONCEPT ANALYSIS**
For each priority product, analyze:
- What PROBLEMS does it solve? (from solves_problems field)
- What are its KEY FUNCTIONS? (from use_case field)  
- What KEYWORDS represent its purpose? (from keywords field)
- What CATEGORY does it belong to? (from category field)

üéØ **STEP 2: CONCEPT-BASED QUERY GENERATION**
Generate 8-12 search queries that will find:

**PRIMARY CONCEPTS (40%)** - Core problems/functions:
- Instead of "AF Build", search for "coral calcification enhancement", "SPS growth supplements"
- Instead of "Ca Plus", search for "calcium supplementation reef", "marine calcium deficiency"
- Instead of "Pro Bio S", search for "beneficial bacteria aquarium", "biological filtration enhancement"

**KNOWLEDGE & EDUCATION (30%)** - Related articles and guides:
- "how to improve coral calcification"
- "reef tank calcium management guide"
- "SPS coral care techniques"
- "biological filtration principles"

**COMPLEMENTARY CONCEPTS (20%)** - Related products and systems:
- Products that work WITH the priority products
- Supporting equipment or supplements
- Testing and monitoring related to the concepts

**PROBLEM VARIATIONS (10%)** - Different ways to express the same issues:
- Alternative terminology for the same problems
- Beginner vs advanced ways of describing issues

## SPECIAL RULES

üö® **GUARANTEED SEARCH AWARENESS**: 
- The priority products {priority_products} will be found through guaranteed search by exact name
- DO NOT waste vector search on names - focus on CONCEPTS and RELATED CONTENT
- Your queries should discover what guaranteed search CANNOT find

üéØ **LANGUAGE ADAPTATION**:
- Generate queries in {language} when appropriate
- Include both technical and beginner-friendly terminology
- Consider regional product naming conventions

üîç **DISCOVERY FOCUS**:
- Prioritize queries that will find knowledge articles
- Look for complementary products and systems
- Find educational content that enhances understanding
- Connect to broader aquarium keeping concepts

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY valid JSON with this structure:

{{
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your concept analysis and why these queries will discover valuable related content",
    "concept_analysis": [
        {{"product": "Product Name", "core_concepts": ["concept1", "concept2"], "related_problems": ["problem1", "problem2"]}}
    ],
    "optimized_queries": [
        "concept-based query 1",
        "concept-based query 2", 
        "educational query 3",
        "complementary system query 4",
        "problem variation query 5",
        "knowledge article query 6",
        "related product query 7",
        "advanced technique query 8"
    ]
}}

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**PRIORITY PRODUCT:** "AF Build"
**CONCEPT ANALYSIS:** Calcium/carbonate supplement for coral calcification, pH buffering, hard coral growth
**REVOLUTIONARY QUERIES:**
- "coral calcification enhancement techniques"
- "calcium carbonate absorption in SPS corals"  
- "hard coral skeletal growth supplements"
- "reef tank pH stabilization methods"
- "SPS feeding and calcification guide"
- "complementary calcium dosing systems"
- "coral growth rate improvement"
- "alkalinity and calcium balance"

Notice: NO queries for "AF Build" itself - that's handled by guaranteed search!
