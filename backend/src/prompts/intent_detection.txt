AQUAFOREST CONTEXT: Aquaforest makes aquarium products - salt, supplements, water chemistry, coral food, fish food, water conditioners, testing kits, and reef maintenance products.

CRITICAL RULES (in priority order):

1. **ANALYZE_ICP** - If user provides an ICP test URL (aquaforestlab.com/results/*)
   → analyze_icp

2. **GREETING** - Only for standalone greetings without questions
   → greeting
   Examples: "Hello!", "Hi!", "Good morning!" (no questions)

3. **BUSINESS** - Partnership, distributorship, commercial cooperation
   → business  
   Examples: "I want to become a distributor", "business partnership"

4. **SUPPORT** - Explicit requests for human contact, complaints, refunds, order issues
   → support
   Examples: "I need help with my order", "I want a refund", "contact support"

5. **PURCHASE_INQUIRY** - Where to buy, availability, pricing questions
   → purchase_inquiry
   Examples: "Where can I buy AF products?", "Do you ship to..."

6. **COMPETITOR** - Direct brand comparisons or opinions about competing brands
   → competitor  
   Examples: "Red Sea vs AF salt?", "What do you think about Seachem?"
   
7. **FOLLOW_UP** - IF chat history exists AND user continues previous topic/asks for clarification
   → follow_up
   Examples: "Tell me more about this one", "How much should I dose?" (after product discussion)

8. **PRODUCT_QUERY** - ALL aquarium-related questions seeking recommendations, advice, or information about:
   - Product recommendations ("what product for...", "which one for...", "recommend something for...")
   - Aquarium problems ("I have algae", "my corals are...", "water parameters...")
   - Dosing questions ("how much to dose", "how to use...")
   - General aquarium advice ("best salt for...", "food for fish", "supplements for corals")
   - Setup questions ("new tank", "what do I need for...")
   - Water chemistry questions ("calcium too low", "alkalinity problems")
   → product_query

9. **CENSORED** - Proprietary/trade secret questions about manufacturing, formulations, or business processes
   → censored
   Examples: "What do you add to salt production?", "How do you manufacture products?", "What's the exact formula?", "What ingredients do you use?", "How much does production cost?"

10. **OTHER** - ONLY for questions completely unrelated to aquariums, products, or business
    → other
    Examples: "What's the weather?", "Tell me a joke", "How to cook pasta?"

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
- Questions about fish food, coral food, aquarium salt, supplements, water conditioners = product_query
- Questions mentioning competitors as context but seeking AF advice = product_query  
- Greeting + question = use intent for the question, not greeting
- ANY aquarium-related question = product_query (unless it fits specific categories above)
- Use "other" VERY RARELY - only for completely non-aquarium topics
- Production/manufacturing/formulation questions = censored
