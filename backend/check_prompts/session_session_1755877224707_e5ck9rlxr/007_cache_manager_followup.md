  <FULL_CONTENT>KH Plus is a highly concentrated liquid agent designed to quickly raise carbonate hardness (KH) in marine aquariums. It is formulated to manage sudden drops in alkalinity, eliminate deficits, and restore ionic balance—essential for the healthy development and calcification of corals, mollusks, and calcifying algae. Stable KH levels (recommended: 6.5–8.5 dKH) support strong coral skeleton formation and help maintain stable pH, which reduces the toxicity of metabolic by-products and aids the absorption of calcium. The formula is of laboratory purity, contains no dyes or preservatives, and is safe for all marine organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of KH Plus increases KH by 0.5 dKH in 100 l of water. Maximum daily dose: 10 ml/100 l (do not raise more than 0.5 dKH per 24 hours). If a higher increase is needed, split the dose over several days. Always verify that magnesium levels are within range before adjusting calcium or KH. To avoid precipitation, never dose KH Plus and Ca Plus at the same time; leave a time gap for full dissolution. Dose directly into an area of strong water flow. KH Plus is suitable for all reef aquariums, including tanks with demanding SPS and LPS corals, snails, clams, and crabs.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <SIZES>Not specified</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ is the key to balanced microelement dosing for marine aquariums. The chemical formula is based on the H. Balling method but has been modified and enriched with essential trace elements. This creates three fluids that, when dosed regularly in equal quantities, meet the coral's demand not only for magnesium and calcium but for all elements whose dosage is otherwise difficult to determine. Product Features: The formula is based on years of experience, providing an ideal ratio of macro and microelements in perfectly balanced fluids that meet all aquarium needs. It ensures proper ionic balance thanks to the inclusion of Reef Mineral Salt. Component Breakdown: Component 1+ contains: Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr, Mo (25ml raises Ca by 4.5 ppm/100L). Component 2+ contains: NaHCO3, F, I (25ml raises KH by 0.65 dKH, which is Alk 0.23 meq/100L). Component 3+ contains: Mg, mineral salts, K, B, Li (25ml raises Mg by 0.38 ppm/100L). Component 3+ contains Reef Mineral Salt, which is essential for stabilizing aquarium parameters. Dosing Instructions: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption and regular water tests (Calcium, Magnesium, KH). For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. To maintain stable parameters, we recommend dividing the daily dose into as many small doses as possible. If the consumption of one element is higher, we recommend supplementing it with a separate solution (Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) until the parameters are balanced. Why is Ionic Balance So Important? The Role of NaCl-Free Salt: The NaCl-free salt used in Component 3+ is seawater with sodium chloride removed. It contains all other essential components like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Bromine, Fluorine, Barium, Iodine, and other trace elements. Its primary role is not just to replenish trace elements, but to maintain the correct ratios of all salts in the seawater, adhering to the Dittmar Principle, which states that the main components of seawater have a constant ratio. When dosing calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to provide building blocks for coral skeletons (CaCO3), a byproduct is created: sodium chloride (NaCl), as shown in the reaction: CaCl2 + 2NaHCO3 => CaCO3 + 2NaCl + H2O + CO2. This excess NaCl disrupts the natural ionic composition of the water. Water changes are often insufficient to correct this imbalance, as a 100% water change would be needed. Neglecting the NaCl-free salt solution, as is common in simplified Balling methods, leads to a gradual depletion of trace elements and an ionic imbalance masked by stable salinity readings generated by excess NaCl. The original, complete Balling method, which includes this third component, is more effective and leads to fewer long-term stability problems.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ Concentrate is a modern and convenient solution for marine aquarists based on the proven Balling method. It is a 5x more concentrated formula of Ca, KH, Mg, and Microelements that ensures ionic balance and raises pH. This product allows for the easy preparation of three solutions (Component 1+, 2+, 3+) that provide all the necessary micro- and macroelements for corals to thrive and display vibrant, intense colors. The concentrated 1-liter formula allows you to prepare 5 liters of each solution, saving space and making transport easier. Key Features: Compact Form: Small, lightweight containers save space in your aquarium room and simplify transport. Easy Preparation: Each concentrate easily dissolves in RO water to create 5 liters of ready-to-use solution. Ideal Balance: Provides all micro- and macroelements needed for healthy coral development and beautiful colors. Preparation Instructions: To prepare 5L of each solution: Concentrate 1+: 1. Shake well and pour the Concentrate 1+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with RO water, close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue remains, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with RO water to the 5L mark and mix until a uniform solution is obtained. Concentrate 2+: 1. Shake well and pour Concentrate 2+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with warm RO water (ideal temperature is 40°C / 104°F), close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue or salt crystals remain, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with warm RO water and mix until all crystals dissolve. Let the solution cool completely for about 1 hour. Sediment or crystallization may occur; this is normal due to the high concentration and does not affect product quality. Concentrate 3+: Follow the same steps as for Concentrate 1+. Dosing: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption. Regular testing of Calcium, Magnesium, and KH is essential. If consumption of one element is higher, prepare a separate solution (e.g., from Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) to dose it individually until parameters are balanced. For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. Direct Dosing (without dilution): This product can be dosed directly, but it is 5 times more concentrated than the standard solution. Extreme caution is advised as sudden parameter shifts can be harmful. 5 ml of concentrate per 100L raises: Component 1+ by 4.5 ppm Ca; Component 2+ by 0.65 dKH; Component 3+ by 0.38 ppm Mg. When dosing Concentrate 2+ directly, a white, gel-like precipitate may form upon contact with water; this is natural and safe. The outlet of the dosing pump for Concentrate 2+ should be in an area of high water flow. FAQ & Important Information: What is Component Concentrate? It is a high-quality concentrate used to prepare Component 1+, 2+, and 3+ solutions for the Balling method to maintain Ca, Mg, and KH levels. How much solution can I make? One 1L bottle of concentrate prepares 5L of ready-to-use solution. Do I have to dilute it? No, but it is recommended for safer and easier dosing as the concentrate is 5x stronger. Can I mix the solutions together? No. They must be stored and dosed separately. For a single solution, use Component 3in1. How often should I test? We recommend weekly testing for Ca, Mg, and KH, or more frequently (every 2-3 days) when adjusting dosage. What if one parameter drops faster than the others? In that case, it is best to prepare a separate solution from Ca Plus, Mg Plus, or KH Plus to supplement only the specific element without disrupting the balance of the others. How long can I store the diluted solutions? For several weeks in a cool, dark place. Shake before use. Does sediment mean the product is bad? No, sediment or crystallization is normal for highly concentrated solutions and does not affect quality. Good to know: For aquarium use only. Not for human consumption. Keep out of reach of children. Due to the high concentration, we recommend regular maintenance of dosing lines.

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Corals are fascinating organisms and a centerpiece of marine aquariums, contributing both stunning aesthetics and crucial biological balance. In modern home aquaristics, coral keeping is accessible to hobbyists at every level—yet each type requires specific care. Corals are colonies of polyps, often building hard external skeletons from calcium carbonate, which form coral reefs. Global threats reduce wild populations, making home reef keeping a unique way to support their future. 

**Main categories of corals:**
- **Soft Corals:** Lack a hard calcium skeleton; built from softer, horny substances. Generally the easiest to keep, tolerant of parameter fluctuations, and ideal for beginners. Examples: Leathery corals (Sarcopython, Sinularia), feather corals (Briareum, Anthelia, Clavularia), sponge-like corals.
  - **Requirements:** Moderate light, good water flow, non-ultrapure water (tolerate some nutrients), minimal supplementation.
- **Hard Corals:** Possess hard calcium skeletons that form reef structures. Divided into:
  - **LPS (Large Polyp Stony Corals):** Large, fleshy polyps, moderate lighting and flow needs, require stable water but less demanding than SPS. Examples: Euphyllia glabrescens, Goniopora, Caulastrea.
    - **Needs:** Medium to strong lighting, stable pH, KH, salinity, regular feeding (especially Scolymia, Acanthastrea).
  - **SPS (Small Polyp Stony Corals):** Tiny, dense polyps, intricate shapes, very demanding. Require ultra-clean water (low NO3/PO4), high and stable light/flow, precise supplementation (KH, Ca, Mg), and near-constant parameter stability. Examples: Acropora, Montipora, Stylophora.
    - **Needs:** Strong lighting, excellent circulation, regular Balling method or similar supplementation, strict stability.

**Choosing corals for your aquarium:**
Visual appeal is only one factor—maintenance complexity, cost, and compatibility matter more for beginners. Start with easy soft corals (Sarcopython, Sinularia, Capnella, Zoanthus), then move to LPS as you gain experience, finally progressing to SPS. Mixed reefs (combining types) are possible, but often require balancing differing requirements.

**Tips:**
- Research each species’ specific needs before purchase
- Gradually increase care difficulty as skills grow
- Monitor water parameters closely and use proper lighting/flow equipment
- Patience and attention to detail are the foundation of successful coral keeping

**Summary:** Corals in a marine aquarium are divided into soft and hard types (LPS/SPS), each with unique care needs. Beginners should start with hardy soft corals, learning fundamentals before progressing. A thriving home reef is possible for anyone willing to learn and adapt.</FULL_TEXT>

# ---------------- ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK (THE "AHA!" MOMENT) ----------------
<<< STEP 1: TRIAGE ANALYSIS (REVISED WITH CONFIDENCE TIERS) >>>
First, analyze the user's query 'Dzięki. Z tych wszystkich opcji, która będzie najbardziej wydajna i skoncentrowana do automatycznej dolewki przez pompę dozującą?' in the full context. Your primary goal is to answer if possible. Classify your ability to answer into ONE of the three following confidence tiers:

1.  **certain_answer (Confidence > 95%):**
    * **Condition:** The answer to the user's question is DIRECTLY and EXPLICITLY stated in the provided `<CACHED PRODUCT INFORMATION>` or conversation history.
    * **Example:** User asks for a link, and the `<URL_PL>` tag is present. User asks about dosage, and the `<DOSAGE>` tag is present.
    * **Action:** Proceed to Blueprint 2 (Concise Answer).

2.  **inferred_answer (Confidence 70-95%):**
    * **Condition:** The answer is NOT directly stated, but you can confidently INFER it by combining information from multiple `<PRODUCT_CARD>`s, your general expert knowledge, AND the conversation context. This requires **Knowledge Fusion**.
    * **Example:** User asks "pro bio s z pro bio f mogę użyć razem?". The product cards state they are both probiotic bacteria for nutrient reduction. You can infer they serve similar functions and advise against using them simultaneously to avoid overdose, explaining they are alternatives.
    * **Action:** Proceed to Blueprint 2 (Concise Answer), but you MUST include a "confidence disclaimer" phrase.

3.  **refer_to_specialist (Confidence < 70%):**
    * **Condition:** The user is asking for information you CANNOT guarantee is correct because it involves safety, undocumented chemical interactions, or is completely absent from the provided data. **This is your safety net.**
    * **NEW RULE:** If the previous response stated that **OceanGuard** sets are unavailable, and the current user query asks for the **reason for this unavailability** (e.g., 'why?', 'what is the reason?'), you **MUST** classify this as `refer_to_specialist`.
    * **Example:** "Can I mix AF NitraPhos Minus with a competitor's product?" or "Is Pro Bio S safe for seahorses?".
    * **Action:** Proceed to Blueprint 3 (Refer to Specialist).

# ---------------- RESPONSE BLUEPRINT (THE ACTION PLAN) ----------------
Now that the analysis is complete, craft your response using the blueprint that matches your triage decision.

<<< BLUEPRINT 2: FOR CONCISE ANSWERS (REVISED) >>>
=== IF TRIAGE DECISION IS certain_answer OR inferred_answer, USE THIS BLUEPRINT: ===
1.  **Direct Answer:** Immediately provide the most direct, concise answer to the user's question.
2.  **(If triage decision was inferred_answer) Add Confidence Disclaimer:** After the direct answer, add a transparent disclaimer.
    * **If pl = "pl":** "Opieram tę odpowiedź na połączeniu danych technicznych naszych produktów i mojej ogólnej wiedzy. Dla 100% pewności w tak specyficznej sytuacji, zawsze warto skonsultować się z naszym oficjalnym supportem."
    * **If pl != "pl":** "I'm basing this answer on a fusion of our technical product data and my general expertise. For 100% certainty in such a specific situation, it's always a great idea to double-check with our official support team."
3.  **Engaging Close:** End with a natural, open-ended question to continue the conversation.
    * **Example (PL):** "Czy to w pełni wyjaśnia Twoje wątpliwości?" lub "Czy mogę pomóc w czymś jeszcze w tym temacie?"
    * **Example (EN):** "Does that fully clarify it for you?" or "Is there anything else I can help with on this topic?"

<<< BLUEPRINT 3: FOR UNCERTAIN INQUIRIES >>>
=== IF TRIAGE DECISION IS refer_to_specialist, USE THIS BLUEPRINT: ===
Honest & Transparent Acknowledgment:
Start by acknowledging the question's importance and clearly state that providing a definitive answer requires specialist knowledge.
Example: "That's a very specific and important question. For matters concerning [the specific topic], it's crucial to get advice directly from our lab specialists to ensure the absolute safety and success of your aquarium."

Explain the 'Why':
Briefly explain why you are referring them. This maintains your expert persona.
Examples: "This falls outside of standard application guidelines, and I don't have documented data on that specific interaction." OR "To give you the most accurate advice, this needs to be assessed by our support team who have access to a wider range of case studies."

The Direct & Actionable Call-to-Action (CTA):
Provide the direct instruction to contact the team, using the language-specific link.
"For a guaranteed and safe answer, please reach out to our expert support team. They will be happy to provide you with the most accurate guidance."
If pl = "pl":
