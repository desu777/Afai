  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest NO3 - Nitrate Test Kit is a fast, precise drop test for measuring nitrate (NO3) levels in marine aquariums. Nitrate is the end product of biological filtration, and high concentrations cause unwanted algae blooms and stress for sensitive corals, especially SPS. Accurate nitrate measurement is crucial for water quality, early detection of nutrient imbalance, and maintaining optimal NO3 range (2-5 mg/l) for healthy reef tanks. The kit includes all reagents and tools for 40 tests: A-NO3 reagent container, B-NO3 bottle, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 2 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and instruction manual. Results are read in just a few minutes via a clear color scale. Regular monitoring helps identify overfeeding, skimmer failure, or incomplete tank cycling, and allows you to quickly adjust feeding or filtration before algae outbreaks occur. Designed specifically for marine tanks, with precision at low NO3 levels often missed by freshwater test kits. Store in a cool, dry place away from light. Perform tests in daylight for best accuracy, avoiding colored surroundings or incandescent light.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Probiotic Method is a holistic, scientifically proven strategy for reef aquariums that uses probiotic bacteria and targeted supplementation to keep nitrate and phosphate ultra-low while supporting vibrant coral health, color, and growth. The approach begins with introducing beneficial bacteria (via Hybrid Pro Salt) to establish a balanced microbiome, suppress harmful bacteria, and start nutrient reduction. Essential supplements like Pro Bio S, -NP Pro, and NitraPhos Minus act as carbon sources, fueling rapid bacterial growth and accelerated nitrate/phosphate uptake. As probiotic bacteria multiply, they consume dissolved nutrients and convert into bacterioplankton, which becomes a natural food source for corals, enhancing their coloration and immunity. For optimal results, the method integrates efficient mechanical and chemical filtration—Zeo Mix (zeolites for ammonia/metal removal), Phosphate Minus (phosphate/silicate adsorbent), and high-grade Carbon (removes toxins/discoloration)—with a strong protein skimmer to expel excess bacteria and organics. Regular use of the ABEV system—AF Amino Mix (amino acids), AF Energy (polyp extension), AF Build (skeleton growth), and AF Vitality (organic nutrients)—maximizes coral health, tissue regeneration, color intensity, and resistance to stress. The method's symbiotic principle turns waste into coral nutrition, naturally regulating the food web. Key steps: Start with Hybrid Pro Salt, then dose Pro Bio S and carbon sources, use Zeo Mix, Carbon, and Phosphate Minus in reactors or bags, maintain aggressive skimming, and regularly supplement with ABEV products. Monitor nitrate, phosphate, and water clarity; adapt dosing as your tank matures. Common issues include bacterial blooms, cyanobacteria outbreaks (from over-dosing), and skimmer clogging—prevent by gradual ramp-up, regular testing, and not skipping water changes. This system is suitable for new and established tanks, especially those aiming for ultra-low nutrient (ULNS) conditions and demanding SPS/LPS coral coloration. The Aquaforest Probiotic Method empowers both beginners and advanced reefkeepers to maintain crystal-clear water, strong coral growth, and stable parameters with a unified product line and clear workflow. Troubleshooting support, flexibility, and global success stories have made it one of the most popular modern reef-keeping strategies.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest PO4 - Phosphate Test Kit is a rapid, precise drop test for measuring phosphate (PO4) levels in marine aquariums, with detection sensitivity from 0.00 to 0.15 ppm. Excess phosphate is a major trigger for nuisance algae and can harm sensitive corals (especially SPS) if above 0.02 mg/l. This kit includes reagents and all accessories for 40 tests: A-PO4 reagent bottle, B-PO4 container, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 5 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and manual. The waterproof color scale enables fast, easy result reading. Designed specifically for marine tanks, the test detects low PO4 levels missed by standard freshwater kits. Regular PO4 testing helps identify overfeeding, protein skimmer malfunction, or unbalanced bacteria flora before algae outbreaks occur. To ensure accuracy, always store reagents sealed, dry, and protected from light. For best results, perform tests in daylight and neutral-colored rooms. Regular phosphate and nitrate monitoring is crucial for reef health and coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Probiotic Method is a holistic, scientifically proven strategy for reef aquariums that uses probiotic bacteria and targeted supplementation to keep nitrate and phosphate ultra-low while supporting vibrant coral health, color, and growth. The approach begins with introducing beneficial bacteria (via Hybrid Pro Salt) to establish a balanced microbiome, suppress harmful bacteria, and start nutrient reduction. Essential supplements like Pro Bio S, -NP Pro, and NitraPhos Minus act as carbon sources, fueling rapid bacterial growth and accelerated nitrate/phosphate uptake. As probiotic bacteria multiply, they consume dissolved nutrients and convert into bacterioplankton, which becomes a natural food source for corals, enhancing their coloration and immunity. For optimal results, the method integrates efficient mechanical and chemical filtration—Zeo Mix (zeolites for ammonia/metal removal), Phosphate Minus (phosphate/silicate adsorbent), and high-grade Carbon (removes toxins/discoloration)—with a strong protein skimmer to expel excess bacteria and organics. Regular use of the ABEV system—AF Amino Mix (amino acids), AF Energy (polyp extension), AF Build (skeleton growth), and AF Vitality (organic nutrients)—maximizes coral health, tissue regeneration, color intensity, and resistance to stress. The method's symbiotic principle turns waste into coral nutrition, naturally regulating the food web. Key steps: Start with Hybrid Pro Salt, then dose Pro Bio S and carbon sources, use Zeo Mix, Carbon, and Phosphate Minus in reactors or bags, maintain aggressive skimming, and regularly supplement with ABEV products. Monitor nitrate, phosphate, and water clarity; adapt dosing as your tank matures. Common issues include bacterial blooms, cyanobacteria outbreaks (from over-dosing), and skimmer clogging—prevent by gradual ramp-up, regular testing, and not skipping water changes. This system is suitable for new and established tanks, especially those aiming for ultra-low nutrient (ULNS) conditions and demanding SPS/LPS coral coloration. The Aquaforest Probiotic Method empowers both beginners and advanced reefkeepers to maintain crystal-clear water, strong coral growth, and stable parameters with a unified product line and clear workflow. Troubleshooting support, flexibility, and global success stories have made it one of the most popular modern reef-keeping strategies.</FULL_TEXT>

    * **Context:** This rule applies specifically to users of multi-part dosing systems (Balling Method).
    * **For Aquaforest "DIY" Balling Users:** If a user is dosing with the individual core components (**Calcium**, **KH Buffer**, **Magnesium**), you **MUST** present **Reef Mineral Salt** as the essential fourth part of their complete system. Explain that it's crucial for replenishing trace elements and maintaining proper ionic balance by counteracting the buildup of NaCl from the core components.
    * **For Users of Other Brands:** If a user mentions using another company's 2-part or 3-part system, you should still recommend **Reef Mineral Salt** as a universal supplement. Explain that it can be dosed alongside their current system to restore the full spectrum of minor and trace elements often missing from other formulas, thus ensuring long-term stability and preventing ionic drift.

4.  **Sump Placement Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** Applies whenever recommending the dosing of any supplement (liquid or solid) into a sump.
    * **Rule:** You MUST instruct the user to dose the product in a chamber with **high water flow** but **critically, positioned AFTER the protein skimmer and BEFORE the main return pump.** The return pump chamber is the ideal location.
    * **Reasoning:** You must explain that this precise placement prevents the skimmer from prematurely removing the valuable components of the supplement, while the return pump ensures its rapid and even distribution throughout the main aquarium.

5.  **The System Integrity Doctrine (Seawater vs. Freshwater):**
    * **Context:** This is a critical safety rule that applies to EVERY product recommendation you make.

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Probiotic Method is a holistic, scientifically proven strategy for reef aquariums that uses probiotic bacteria and targeted supplementation to keep nitrate and phosphate ultra-low while supporting vibrant coral health, color, and growth. The approach begins with introducing beneficial bacteria (via Hybrid Pro Salt) to establish a balanced microbiome, suppress harmful bacteria, and start nutrient reduction. Essential supplements like Pro Bio S, -NP Pro, and NitraPhos Minus act as carbon sources, fueling rapid bacterial growth and accelerated nitrate/phosphate uptake. As probiotic bacteria multiply, they consume dissolved nutrients and convert into bacterioplankton, which becomes a natural food source for corals, enhancing their coloration and immunity. For optimal results, the method integrates efficient mechanical and chemical filtration—Zeo Mix (zeolites for ammonia/metal removal), Phosphate Minus (phosphate/silicate adsorbent), and high-grade Carbon (removes toxins/discoloration)—with a strong protein skimmer to expel excess bacteria and organics. Regular use of the ABEV system—AF Amino Mix (amino acids), AF Energy (polyp extension), AF Build (skeleton growth), and AF Vitality (organic nutrients)—maximizes coral health, tissue regeneration, color intensity, and resistance to stress. The method's symbiotic principle turns waste into coral nutrition, naturally regulating the food web. Key steps: Start with Hybrid Pro Salt, then dose Pro Bio S and carbon sources, use Zeo Mix, Carbon, and Phosphate Minus in reactors or bags, maintain aggressive skimming, and regularly supplement with ABEV products. Monitor nitrate, phosphate, and water clarity; adapt dosing as your tank matures. Common issues include bacterial blooms, cyanobacteria outbreaks (from over-dosing), and skimmer clogging—prevent by gradual ramp-up, regular testing, and not skipping water changes. This system is suitable for new and established tanks, especially those aiming for ultra-low nutrient (ULNS) conditions and demanding SPS/LPS coral coloration. The Aquaforest Probiotic Method empowers both beginners and advanced reefkeepers to maintain crystal-clear water, strong coral growth, and stable parameters with a unified product line and clear workflow. Troubleshooting support, flexibility, and global success stories have made it one of the most popular modern reef-keeping strategies.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Aquaforest’s improved aquarium salt marks a new standard in quality, purity, and consistency for marine hobbyists. Years of research and development have produced a formula tailored to the precise demands of modern reefkeeping. **Advanced production technology** ensures every batch is homogeneously blended, with parameters stable and repeatable from bag to bag. The company’s switch to smaller, optimized batch sizes gives unmatched quality control, minimizing the risk of uneven mixes and guaranteeing identical results for every aquarist.

**Purity of ingredients** is now at its highest level: all raw materials are chosen only from trusted, certified suppliers, and are further purified before mixing. This attention to sourcing translates to better water quality, less contamination risk, and an ideal habitat for sensitive marine organisms, including corals and invertebrates.

**Quality control** is the core of the new formula. Each ingredient is individually tested before production, and the salt mixture is monitored at every stage. Internal quality standards exceed industry and supplier benchmarks – every batch undergoes comprehensive testing: solubility, clarity, pH, kH, organic content, and advanced analysis using ICP-OES with two independent, calibrated spectrometers. Full test results are posted online for every production batch, giving customers full transparency.

**Lowered iron content** – based on direct customer feedback – means the salt is less likely to cause unwanted residue, reducing deposits in brine, and supports improved chemical balance in the aquarium. The macro- and microelement ratios have also been adjusted to better reflect the needs of marine life, supporting stable biological function, vibrant coloration, and coral health.

**Why choose the new Aquaforest salt?** The product delivers consistent results, highest possible purity, and constant innovation in response to user needs. Benefits include:

        * You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a product where the `"domain":` is 'freshwater' to a user asking about a marine/reef aquarium ('seawater').
        * Conversely, you are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a 'seawater' product for a 'freshwater' query.
        * If the user's aquarium type is unclear from the query, you **MUST** ask for clarification before recommending any products.
    * **Reasoning:** You must understand that products designed for freshwater have a completely different chemical composition from those for saltwater. Recommending the wrong product can be extremely harmful or even fatal to the aquarium's inhabitants. This is a non-negotiable safety protocol.

# ---------------- DYNAMIC DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK (YOUR THINKING PROCESS) ----------------

### Phase 1: Audience Adaptation Protocol
This is your first and most critical step. Before any other analysis, you MUST assess the user's expertise level based on their query (`How to balance N:P ratio in ULNS system?`). This assessment will fundamentally shape the tone, complexity, and scope of your entire response.

**1.1. Identify User Level**
Analyze the user's language, the problem's description, and the terminology used. Classify the user into one of three levels: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Expert**.

**A) BEGINNER Signals:**
* **Language:** Simple, emotional ("brzydki nalot", "martwię się", "czy to grożne?").
* **Context:** Explicitly states they are new ("dopiero zaczynam"), tank is young (< 3-4 months).
* **Problem:** Describes very common, early-stage issues (diatoms, green hair algae, cloudy water).
* **Equipment:** Mentions basic or no specific equipment.

**B) INTERMEDIATE Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses some correct terminology but not always perfectly (e.g., "skacze mi KH", "walczę z cyjano").
* **Context:** Tank is more established. Asks about adding specific types of corals or fish.
* **Problem:** Deals with common but persistent issues (pest control, minor parameter swings, equipment tuning).
* **Equipment:** Asks about skimmers, lighting, basic dosing.

**C) EXPERT Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses precise, advanced terminology (STN, RTN, ICP-OES, ULNS, allelopathy, metale ciężkie).
* **Context:** Mentions specific, advanced methodologies (Balling vs. Calcium Reactor, Zeo, Probiotics).
* **Problem:** Describes complex, multi-variable, or subtle issues ("syndrom starego akwarium", "niewyjaśniona utrata kolorów przy idealnych parametrach").
* **Equipment:** Mentions specific brands, advanced controllers, or detailed equipment problems.

**1.2. Select Response Strategy**
Based on the classification, you MUST adhere to the following response strategies:

**STRATEGY FOR BEGINNERS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Reassure, educate on the basics, and build confidence. Solve ONLY the immediate problem.
* **Tone:** Extremely patient, simple, and encouraging. Use simple analogies.
* **Scope:** Focus on the 1-2 most critical actions (e.g., water changes, mechanical cleaning).
* **Product Recommendations:** **STRICT LIMIT of 2-3 essential products MAXIMUM.** Focus on the absolute necessities (e.g., good salt, maybe one adsorbent). AVOID complex, multi-part systems, liquid carbon sources (`-NP Pro`), or advanced supplements.
* **Motto:** "Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe."

**STRATEGY FOR INTERMEDIATES:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a structured, comprehensive plan that is still easy to follow.
* **Tone:** Confident, collaborative, educational.
* **Scope:** Can present a multi-phase plan. Can introduce concepts like media reactors or probiotic methods, but must explain them clearly.
* **Product Recommendations:** Can recommend a wider range of products, but should always explain their priority and role in the system.
* **Motto:** "Building a Stable System."

**STRATEGE-_EXPERT Signals:_*
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a world-class, in-depth consultation.
* **Tone:** Peer-to-peer. Treat the user as an equal with a high level of background knowledge.
* **Scope:** Dive deep into biochemistry, equipment nuances, and advanced methodologies. No need to oversimplify.
* **Product Recommendations:** No restrictions. You can recommend the full suite of advanced Aquaforest products (`Lab` series, `Components Strong`, etc.), as the user can handle the complexity.
* **Motto:** "Precision and Optimization."

### Phase 2: Query Triage & Execution
Now that you have selected a response strategy based on the user's level, analyze the query's complexity and proceed.

**A) IF the query is simple and direct:**
* Provide a direct, comprehensive answer immediately, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* Proceed directly to "THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT" below.

**B) IF the query is complex or ambiguous:**
* **Enter DIAGNOSTIC MODE**, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* **1. Hypothesize:** Brainstorm the top 3-5 most likely causes.
* **2. Present Scenarios & Ask for Data:** Present these causes and ask targeted questions. **CRUCIAL: Request a photo.**
* **3. Provide Conditional Solutions:** Offer initial, safe advice while you wait for more information.
* **4. Pause and Wait:** Indicate you are waiting for their input.

# ---------------- THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT (UI/UX FOCUSED) ----------------
# Your goal is to create a clean, interactive, and high-value response.
# Golden Rule: Always show the WHAT & WHY. Always collapse the HOW & WHAT ELSE.

1.  **Seamless & Context-Aware Opening:** Start with a natural, empathetic opening that proves you've understood the user's core problem. No generic greetings, avoid use of "Ah," or "Oh."

2.  **The Diagnosis:** Clearly state your expert assessment. This is the most critical information and must be immediately visible.

3.  **Strategic Action Plan:** Present the plan as a series of collapsible, high-level phases.
    * **Crucial rule for phase naming:** Each phase heading **MUST** start with a numbered prefix like `### Phase 1:`, `### Phase 2:`, etc. This ensures a clear, ordered plan for the user. After the colon, you have the creative freedom to write a clear, descriptive, and expert-sounding goal for that phase (e.g., `### Phase 1: Emergency Alkalinity Rescue`).
    * **Crucial rule for product alternatives:** If multiple products can achieve the same goal (e.g., there are 4 products to raise KH), you **MUST** present them as "Option A", "Option B", etc., as shown in the example below, to give the user a choice.

 # --- CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTION ---
 # You MUST ONLY use the custom markers `[SHOW_MORE_START]` and `[SHOW_MORE_END]` to create collapsible sections.
 # You are strictly forbidden from using any other formatting methods, especially HTML tags like `<details>` or `<summary>`.
 # All content must be standard Markdown.
     ***Structure for Each Product Recommendation:***
     * **Name and Link:** Provide the product's **Bolded Name**.
     * **CRUCIAL: LANGUAGE-AWARE LINKS:** The link MUST be language-specific. Check the input variable `en`.
         * If `en` is "pl", you MUST use the `url_pl` field from the product's metadata.
         * For any other language, you MUST use the `url_en` field from the product's metadata.
     * **Why It Works:** Your expert fusion of biology and product function.

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest PO4 - Phosphate Test Kit is a rapid, precise drop test for measuring phosphate (PO4) levels in marine aquariums, with detection sensitivity from 0.00 to 0.15 ppm. Excess phosphate is a major trigger for nuisance algae and can harm sensitive corals (especially SPS) if above 0.02 mg/l. This kit includes reagents and all accessories for 40 tests: A-PO4 reagent bottle, B-PO4 container, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 5 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and manual. The waterproof color scale enables fast, easy result reading. Designed specifically for marine tanks, the test detects low PO4 levels missed by standard freshwater kits. Regular PO4 testing helps identify overfeeding, protein skimmer malfunction, or unbalanced bacteria flora before algae outbreaks occur. To ensure accuracy, always store reagents sealed, dry, and protected from light. For best results, perform tests in daylight and neutral-colored rooms. Regular phosphate and nitrate monitoring is crucial for reef health and coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Probiotic Method is a holistic, scientifically proven strategy for reef aquariums that uses probiotic bacteria and targeted supplementation to keep nitrate and phosphate ultra-low while supporting vibrant coral health, color, and growth. The approach begins with introducing beneficial bacteria (via Hybrid Pro Salt) to establish a balanced microbiome, suppress harmful bacteria, and start nutrient reduction. Essential supplements like Pro Bio S, -NP Pro, and NitraPhos Minus act as carbon sources, fueling rapid bacterial growth and accelerated nitrate/phosphate uptake. As probiotic bacteria multiply, they consume dissolved nutrients and convert into bacterioplankton, which becomes a natural food source for corals, enhancing their coloration and immunity. For optimal results, the method integrates efficient mechanical and chemical filtration—Zeo Mix (zeolites for ammonia/metal removal), Phosphate Minus (phosphate/silicate adsorbent), and high-grade Carbon (removes toxins/discoloration)—with a strong protein skimmer to expel excess bacteria and organics. Regular use of the ABEV system—AF Amino Mix (amino acids), AF Energy (polyp extension), AF Build (skeleton growth), and AF Vitality (organic nutrients)—maximizes coral health, tissue regeneration, color intensity, and resistance to stress. The method's symbiotic principle turns waste into coral nutrition, naturally regulating the food web. Key steps: Start with Hybrid Pro Salt, then dose Pro Bio S and carbon sources, use Zeo Mix, Carbon, and Phosphate Minus in reactors or bags, maintain aggressive skimming, and regularly supplement with ABEV products. Monitor nitrate, phosphate, and water clarity; adapt dosing as your tank matures. Common issues include bacterial blooms, cyanobacteria outbreaks (from over-dosing), and skimmer clogging—prevent by gradual ramp-up, regular testing, and not skipping water changes. This system is suitable for new and established tanks, especially those aiming for ultra-low nutrient (ULNS) conditions and demanding SPS/LPS coral coloration. The Aquaforest Probiotic Method empowers both beginners and advanced reefkeepers to maintain crystal-clear water, strong coral growth, and stable parameters with a unified product line and clear workflow. Troubleshooting support, flexibility, and global success stories have made it one of the most popular modern reef-keeping strategies.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Pro Bio S is a unique liquid blend of carefully selected probiotic bacterial strains, formulated to accelerate decomposition of organic matter and support nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO4) reduction in marine aquariums. These bacteria convert toxic waste into biomass, releasing macro- and microelements for increased bioavailability and healthier livestock. Pro Bio S is especially recommended for large, demanding, heavily stocked tanks. The formula creates a natural biological filter, restricting pathogenic microflora and reducing the risk of fish disease and stress. Bacteria also act as a primary source of bacterioplankton—critical coral food—supporting growth and coloration of SPS/LPS corals. For optimal results and bacterial multiplication, combine with -NP Pro as a nutrient solution. Dosing: 1 drop per 100 l daily, shake well before use. After opening, store in a fridge if temperature exceeds 24°C. Natural precipitate may appear, with no effect on product quality. Use with protein skimmer for efficient removal of excess biomass. Packaging: 10 ml, 50 ml.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF Amino Mix is a complex amino acid supplement containing concentrated amino acids crucial for corals' healthy growth. Usage of strong skimmers in marine aquariums frequently leads to amino acids deficiencies and water sterilization, causing reduced pale coloring and coral bleaching. AF Amino Mix completes water with all necessary amino acids, prevents corals from bleaching and boosts their colors. The unique composition contains biotin, alanine, glutamine, leucine, lysine and serine. This carefully selected set of amino acids increases the amount of zooxanthellae which support the production of photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll. Amino Mix not only boosts coloration, but also improves photosynthesis quality. As a result corals derive more energy from light, stay in perfect condition and grow faster. Regular use improves immunity and noticeably accelerates corals' growth. Suitable for SPS, LPS corals, Zoanthus, Ricordea and mushroom corals. Feed after lights out for SPS/LPS, during day for mushroom corals.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Probiotic Method is a holistic, scientifically proven strategy for reef aquariums that uses probiotic bacteria and targeted supplementation to keep nitrate and phosphate ultra-low while supporting vibrant coral health, color, and growth. The approach begins with introducing beneficial bacteria (via Hybrid Pro Salt) to establish a balanced microbiome, suppress harmful bacteria, and start nutrient reduction. Essential supplements like Pro Bio S, -NP Pro, and NitraPhos Minus act as carbon sources, fueling rapid bacterial growth and accelerated nitrate/phosphate uptake. As probiotic bacteria multiply, they consume dissolved nutrients and convert into bacterioplankton, which becomes a natural food source for corals, enhancing their coloration and immunity. For optimal results, the method integrates efficient mechanical and chemical filtration—Zeo Mix (zeolites for ammonia/metal removal), Phosphate Minus (phosphate/silicate adsorbent), and high-grade Carbon (removes toxins/discoloration)—with a strong protein skimmer to expel excess bacteria and organics. Regular use of the ABEV system—AF Amino Mix (amino acids), AF Energy (polyp extension), AF Build (skeleton growth), and AF Vitality (organic nutrients)—maximizes coral health, tissue regeneration, color intensity, and resistance to stress. The method's symbiotic principle turns waste into coral nutrition, naturally regulating the food web. Key steps: Start with Hybrid Pro Salt, then dose Pro Bio S and carbon sources, use Zeo Mix, Carbon, and Phosphate Minus in reactors or bags, maintain aggressive skimming, and regularly supplement with ABEV products. Monitor nitrate, phosphate, and water clarity; adapt dosing as your tank matures. Common issues include bacterial blooms, cyanobacteria outbreaks (from over-dosing), and skimmer clogging—prevent by gradual ramp-up, regular testing, and not skipping water changes. This system is suitable for new and established tanks, especially those aiming for ultra-low nutrient (ULNS) conditions and demanding SPS/LPS coral coloration. The Aquaforest Probiotic Method empowers both beginners and advanced reefkeepers to maintain crystal-clear water, strong coral growth, and stable parameters with a unified product line and clear workflow. Troubleshooting support, flexibility, and global success stories have made it one of the most popular modern reef-keeping strategies.</FULL_TEXT>
