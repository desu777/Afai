  <DOSAGE>25ml per 100L, daily, as needed</DOSAGE>
  <COMPATIBLE_WITH>Calcium, Magnesium, KH Buffer</COMPATIBLE_WITH>
  <SIZES>Not specified</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ is the key to balanced microelement dosing for marine aquariums. The chemical formula is based on the H. Balling method but has been modified and enriched with essential trace elements. This creates three fluids that, when dosed regularly in equal quantities, meet the coral's demand not only for magnesium and calcium but for all elements whose dosage is otherwise difficult to determine. Product Features: The formula is based on years of experience, providing an ideal ratio of macro and microelements in perfectly balanced fluids that meet all aquarium needs. It ensures proper ionic balance thanks to the inclusion of Reef Mineral Salt. Component Breakdown: Component 1+ contains: Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr, Mo (25ml raises Ca by 4.5 ppm/100L). Component 2+ contains: NaHCO3, F, I (25ml raises KH by 0.65 dKH, which is Alk 0.23 meq/100L). Component 3+ contains: Mg, mineral salts, K, B, Li (25ml raises Mg by 0.38 ppm/100L). Component 3+ contains Reef Mineral Salt, which is essential for stabilizing aquarium parameters. Dosing Instructions: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption and regular water tests (Calcium, Magnesium, KH). For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. To maintain stable parameters, we recommend dividing the daily dose into as many small doses as possible. If the consumption of one element is higher, we recommend supplementing it with a separate solution (Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) until the parameters are balanced. Why is Ionic Balance So Important? The Role of NaCl-Free Salt: The NaCl-free salt used in Component 3+ is seawater with sodium chloride removed. It contains all other essential components like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Bromine, Fluorine, Barium, Iodine, and other trace elements. Its primary role is not just to replenish trace elements, but to maintain the correct ratios of all salts in the seawater, adhering to the Dittmar Principle, which states that the main components of seawater have a constant ratio. When dosing calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to provide building blocks for coral skeletons (CaCO3), a byproduct is created: sodium chloride (NaCl), as shown in the reaction: CaCl2 + 2NaHCO3 => CaCO3 + 2NaCl + H2O + CO2. This excess NaCl disrupts the natural ionic composition of the water. Water changes are often insufficient to correct this imbalance, as a 100% water change would be needed. Neglecting the NaCl-free salt solution, as is common in simplified Balling methods, leads to a gradual depletion of trace elements and an ionic imbalance masked by stable salinity readings generated by excess NaCl. The original, complete Balling method, which includes this third component, is more effective and leads to fewer long-term stability problems.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <SIZES>1L</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ Concentrate is a modern and convenient solution for marine aquarists based on the proven Balling method. It is a 5x more concentrated formula of Ca, KH, Mg, and Microelements that ensures ionic balance and raises pH. This product allows for the easy preparation of three solutions (Component 1+, 2+, 3+) that provide all the necessary micro- and macroelements for corals to thrive and display vibrant, intense colors. The concentrated 1-liter formula allows you to prepare 5 liters of each solution, saving space and making transport easier. Key Features: Compact Form: Small, lightweight containers save space in your aquarium room and simplify transport. Easy Preparation: Each concentrate easily dissolves in RO water to create 5 liters of ready-to-use solution. Ideal Balance: Provides all micro- and macroelements needed for healthy coral development and beautiful colors. Preparation Instructions: To prepare 5L of each solution: Concentrate 1+: 1. Shake well and pour the Concentrate 1+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with RO water, close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue remains, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with RO water to the 5L mark and mix until a uniform solution is obtained. Concentrate 2+: 1. Shake well and pour Concentrate 2+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with warm RO water (ideal temperature is 40°C / 104°F), close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue or salt crystals remain, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with warm RO water and mix until all crystals dissolve. Let the solution cool completely for about 1 hour. Sediment or crystallization may occur; this is normal due to the high concentration and does not affect product quality. Concentrate 3+: Follow the same steps as for Concentrate 1+. Dosing: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption. Regular testing of Calcium, Magnesium, and KH is essential. If consumption of one element is higher, prepare a separate solution (e.g., from Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) to dose it individually until parameters are balanced. For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. Direct Dosing (without dilution): This product can be dosed directly, but it is 5 times more concentrated than the standard solution. Extreme caution is advised as sudden parameter shifts can be harmful. 5 ml of concentrate per 100L raises: Component 1+ by 4.5 ppm Ca; Component 2+ by 0.65 dKH; Component 3+ by 0.38 ppm Mg. When dosing Concentrate 2+ directly, a white, gel-like precipitate may form upon contact with water; this is natural and safe. The outlet of the dosing pump for Concentrate 2+ should be in an area of high water flow. FAQ & Important Information: What is Component Concentrate? It is a high-quality concentrate used to prepare Component 1+, 2+, and 3+ solutions for the Balling method to maintain Ca, Mg, and KH levels. How much solution can I make? One 1L bottle of concentrate prepares 5L of ready-to-use solution. Do I have to dilute it? No, but it is recommended for safer and easier dosing as the concentrate is 5x stronger. Can I mix the solutions together? No. They must be stored and dosed separately. For a single solution, use Component 3in1. How often should I test? We recommend weekly testing for Ca, Mg, and KH, or more frequently (every 2-3 days) when adjusting dosage. What if one parameter drops faster than the others? In that case, it is best to prepare a separate solution from Ca Plus, Mg Plus, or KH Plus to supplement only the specific element without disrupting the balance of the others. How long can I store the diluted solutions? For several weeks in a cool, dark place. Shake before use. Does sediment mean the product is bad? No, sediment or crystallization is normal for highly concentrated solutions and does not affect quality. Good to know: For aquarium use only. Not for human consumption. Keep out of reach of children. Due to the high concentration, we recommend regular maintenance of dosing lines.

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>KH Plus is a highly concentrated liquid agent designed to quickly raise carbonate hardness (KH) in marine aquariums. It is formulated to manage sudden drops in alkalinity, eliminate deficits, and restore ionic balance—essential for the healthy development and calcification of corals, mollusks, and calcifying algae. Stable KH levels (recommended: 6.5–8.5 dKH) support strong coral skeleton formation and help maintain stable pH, which reduces the toxicity of metabolic by-products and aids the absorption of calcium. The formula is of laboratory purity, contains no dyes or preservatives, and is safe for all marine organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of KH Plus increases KH by 0.5 dKH in 100 l of water. Maximum daily dose: 10 ml/100 l (do not raise more than 0.5 dKH per 24 hours). If a higher increase is needed, split the dose over several days. Always verify that magnesium levels are within range before adjusting calcium or KH. To avoid precipitation, never dose KH Plus and Ca Plus at the same time; leave a time gap for full dissolution. Dose directly into an area of strong water flow. KH Plus is suitable for all reef aquariums, including tanks with demanding SPS and LPS corals, snails, clams, and crabs.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <COMPATIBLE_WITH>Calcium, Magnesium, KH Buffer</COMPATIBLE_WITH>
  <SIZES>Not specified</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ is the key to balanced microelement dosing for marine aquariums. The chemical formula is based on the H. Balling method but has been modified and enriched with essential trace elements. This creates three fluids that, when dosed regularly in equal quantities, meet the coral's demand not only for magnesium and calcium but for all elements whose dosage is otherwise difficult to determine. Product Features: The formula is based on years of experience, providing an ideal ratio of macro and microelements in perfectly balanced fluids that meet all aquarium needs. It ensures proper ionic balance thanks to the inclusion of Reef Mineral Salt. Component Breakdown: Component 1+ contains: Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr, Mo (25ml raises Ca by 4.5 ppm/100L). Component 2+ contains: NaHCO3, F, I (25ml raises KH by 0.65 dKH, which is Alk 0.23 meq/100L). Component 3+ contains: Mg, mineral salts, K, B, Li (25ml raises Mg by 0.38 ppm/100L). Component 3+ contains Reef Mineral Salt, which is essential for stabilizing aquarium parameters. Dosing Instructions: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption and regular water tests (Calcium, Magnesium, KH). For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. To maintain stable parameters, we recommend dividing the daily dose into as many small doses as possible. If the consumption of one element is higher, we recommend supplementing it with a separate solution (Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) until the parameters are balanced. Why is Ionic Balance So Important? The Role of NaCl-Free Salt: The NaCl-free salt used in Component 3+ is seawater with sodium chloride removed. It contains all other essential components like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Bromine, Fluorine, Barium, Iodine, and other trace elements. Its primary role is not just to replenish trace elements, but to maintain the correct ratios of all salts in the seawater, adhering to the Dittmar Principle, which states that the main components of seawater have a constant ratio. When dosing calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to provide building blocks for coral skeletons (CaCO3), a byproduct is created: sodium chloride (NaCl), as shown in the reaction: CaCl2 + 2NaHCO3 => CaCO3 + 2NaCl + H2O + CO2. This excess NaCl disrupts the natural ionic composition of the water. Water changes are often insufficient to correct this imbalance, as a 100% water change would be needed. Neglecting the NaCl-free salt solution, as is common in simplified Balling methods, leads to a gradual depletion of trace elements and an ionic imbalance masked by stable salinity readings generated by excess NaCl. The original, complete Balling method, which includes this third component, is more effective and leads to fewer long-term stability problems.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ Concentrate is a modern and convenient solution for marine aquarists based on the proven Balling method. It is a 5x more concentrated formula of Ca, KH, Mg, and Microelements that ensures ionic balance and raises pH. This product allows for the easy preparation of three solutions (Component 1+, 2+, 3+) that provide all the necessary micro- and macroelements for corals to thrive and display vibrant, intense colors. The concentrated 1-liter formula allows you to prepare 5 liters of each solution, saving space and making transport easier. Key Features: Compact Form: Small, lightweight containers save space in your aquarium room and simplify transport. Easy Preparation: Each concentrate easily dissolves in RO water to create 5 liters of ready-to-use solution. Ideal Balance: Provides all micro- and macroelements needed for healthy coral development and beautiful colors. Preparation Instructions: To prepare 5L of each solution: Concentrate 1+: 1. Shake well and pour the Concentrate 1+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with RO water, close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue remains, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with RO water to the 5L mark and mix until a uniform solution is obtained. Concentrate 2+: 1. Shake well and pour Concentrate 2+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with warm RO water (ideal temperature is 40°C / 104°F), close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue or salt crystals remain, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with warm RO water and mix until all crystals dissolve. Let the solution cool completely for about 1 hour. Sediment or crystallization may occur; this is normal due to the high concentration and does not affect product quality. Concentrate 3+: Follow the same steps as for Concentrate 1+. Dosing: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption. Regular testing of Calcium, Magnesium, and KH is essential. If consumption of one element is higher, prepare a separate solution (e.g., from Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) to dose it individually until parameters are balanced. For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. Direct Dosing (without dilution): This product can be dosed directly, but it is 5 times more concentrated than the standard solution. Extreme caution is advised as sudden parameter shifts can be harmful. 5 ml of concentrate per 100L raises: Component 1+ by 4.5 ppm Ca; Component 2+ by 0.65 dKH; Component 3+ by 0.38 ppm Mg. When dosing Concentrate 2+ directly, a white, gel-like precipitate may form upon contact with water; this is natural and safe. The outlet of the dosing pump for Concentrate 2+ should be in an area of high water flow. FAQ & Important Information: What is Component Concentrate? It is a high-quality concentrate used to prepare Component 1+, 2+, and 3+ solutions for the Balling method to maintain Ca, Mg, and KH levels. How much solution can I make? One 1L bottle of concentrate prepares 5L of ready-to-use solution. Do I have to dilute it? No, but it is recommended for safer and easier dosing as the concentrate is 5x stronger. Can I mix the solutions together? No. They must be stored and dosed separately. For a single solution, use Component 3in1. How often should I test? We recommend weekly testing for Ca, Mg, and KH, or more frequently (every 2-3 days) when adjusting dosage. What if one parameter drops faster than the others? In that case, it is best to prepare a separate solution from Ca Plus, Mg Plus, or KH Plus to supplement only the specific element without disrupting the balance of the others. How long can I store the diluted solutions? For several weeks in a cool, dark place. Shake before use. Does sediment mean the product is bad? No, sediment or crystallization is normal for highly concentrated solutions and does not affect quality. Good to know: For aquarium use only. Not for human consumption. Keep out of reach of children. Due to the high concentration, we recommend regular maintenance of dosing lines.

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Magnesium is a concentrated powdered supplement designed for stabilizing and raising magnesium levels in marine and reef aquariums. Magnesium is the third most important macroelement (after KH and calcium) for proper coral calcification, supporting the development and growth of SPS and LPS corals, and is also essential for mollusks and snails. A deficiency of magnesium can lead to unstable calcium and pH levels, rapid calcium depletion, and increased carbonate hardness (KH). This product is a key component of the Balling method and ensures ionic balance, optimal coral health, and proper calcium absorption. Each 10 g dissolves in 1000 ml RODI water, and 100 ml of solution raises magnesium by 1.2 mg/l (ppm) per 100 liters of water. Do not raise magnesium by more than 50 ppm per day. Magnesium can be combined with Calcium or Reef Mineral Salt into one solution. Easy to prepare, can be dosed manually or with a dosing pump. Regular testing with a reliable Magnesium Test Kit (such as Aquaforest Test) is recommended to set dosing based on coral consumption. Key ingredient: magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2x6H2O). Package: 750 g, 4000 g. Use only for marine aquariums. Store away from children, not for human consumption.</FULL_CONTENT>

The Role of Strontium and Barium: Strontium is a key element that supports the formation of coral skeletal tissue and significantly improves calcium absorption. It also benefits the growth of soft corals. Barium is a trace element that plays a role in the calcification process, helping to harden the coral skeleton. Together, they are crucial for the healthy development of SPS and LPS corals, soft corals, and clams. Safe and Effective: The safe concentration of the formula minimizes the risk of overdose, making Component A suitable even for beginner aquarists. Dosing Instructions: There are three ways to dose this product: 1. Weekly Dosing: In a mixed-reef aquarium, add 5 ml per 100 l (27 US gal) of water once a week. 2. Calcium-Based Dosing: Adjust the dose based on calcium consumption - add 1 ml for every 20 ppm of calcium used per 100 l (27 US gal) of water. 3. Balling Method: When using the Balling method, add 20 ml of Component A per 1 liter of Calcium solution. Important: When using Components A, B, and C, always wait at least 5 minutes between dosing each component. Do not mix or store the components in the same container.

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>
  <CATEGORY>reef_maintenance</CATEGORY>
  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>KH Plus is a highly concentrated liquid agent designed to quickly raise carbonate hardness (KH) in marine aquariums. It is formulated to manage sudden drops in alkalinity, eliminate deficits, and restore ionic balance—essential for the healthy development and calcification of corals, mollusks, and calcifying algae. Stable KH levels (recommended: 6.5–8.5 dKH) support strong coral skeleton formation and help maintain stable pH, which reduces the toxicity of metabolic by-products and aids the absorption of calcium. The formula is of laboratory purity, contains no dyes or preservatives, and is safe for all marine organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of KH Plus increases KH by 0.5 dKH in 100 l of water. Maximum daily dose: 10 ml/100 l (do not raise more than 0.5 dKH per 24 hours). If a higher increase is needed, split the dose over several days. Always verify that magnesium levels are within range before adjusting calcium or KH. To avoid precipitation, never dose KH Plus and Ca Plus at the same time; leave a time gap for full dissolution. Dose directly into an area of strong water flow. KH Plus is suitable for all reef aquariums, including tanks with demanding SPS and LPS corals, snails, clams, and crabs.</FULL_CONTENT>

LANGUAGE: en
CONFIDENCE: {confidence:.2f}
AQUARIUM VOLUME: Not specified






# ---------------- THE CORE AF DOCTRINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES) ----------------
1.  **Maintenance vs. Boosting - The Golden Rule:**
    * **MAINTENANCE Products** (e.g., Component 1+2+3+) are for **maintaining** balanced parameters. They are NOT for correcting specific deficiencies.
    * **BOOSTING Products** (e.g., Lab series) are for **actively raising** specific low elements.
    * **Your Logic:** Always recommend BOOSTING products to fix a problem first. Then, recommend MAINTENANCE products for long-term stability.

2.  **Anti-Competitor Shield:**
    * Never recommend or praise a competitor's product.
    * If a user mentions a competitor, treat it as a trigger. Pivot immediately to the superior Aquaforest alternative, explaining why it's the better choice.

3.  **The Reef Mineral Salt Doctrine - For Ionic Balance:**
    * **Context:** This rule applies specifically to users of multi-part dosing systems (Balling Method).
    * **For Aquaforest "DIY" Balling Users:** If a user is dosing with the individual core components (**Calcium**, **KH Buffer**, **Magnesium**), you **MUST** present **Reef Mineral Salt** as the essential fourth part of their complete system. Explain that it's crucial for replenishing trace elements and maintaining proper ionic balance by counteracting the buildup of NaCl from the core components.
    * **For Users of Other Brands:** If a user mentions using another company's 2-part or 3-part system, you should still recommend **Reef Mineral Salt** as a universal supplement. Explain that it can be dosed alongside their current system to restore the full spectrum of minor and trace elements often missing from other formulas, thus ensuring long-term stability and preventing ionic drift.

4.  **Sump Placement Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** Applies whenever recommending the dosing of any supplement (liquid or solid) into a sump.
    * **Rule:** You MUST instruct the user to dose the product in a chamber with **high water flow** but **critically, positioned AFTER the protein skimmer and BEFORE the main return pump.** The return pump chamber is the ideal location.
    * **Reasoning:** You must explain that this precise placement prevents the skimmer from prematurely removing the valuable components of the supplement, while the return pump ensures its rapid and even distribution throughout the main aquarium.

5.  **The System Integrity Doctrine (Seawater vs. Freshwater):**
    * **Context:** This is a critical safety rule that applies to EVERY product recommendation you make.
    * **Rule:** Before recommending any product, you MUST check its `"domain":` field in the provided `

  <CATEGORY>balling_method</CATEGORY>
  <DOMAIN>seawater</DOMAIN>
  <DIFFICULTY>beginner</DIFFICULTY>
  <DOSAGE>25ml per 100L, daily, as needed</DOSAGE>
  <COMPATIBLE_WITH>Calcium, Magnesium, KH Buffer</COMPATIBLE_WITH>
  <SIZES>Not specified</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ is the key to balanced microelement dosing for marine aquariums. The chemical formula is based on the H. Balling method but has been modified and enriched with essential trace elements. This creates three fluids that, when dosed regularly in equal quantities, meet the coral's demand not only for magnesium and calcium but for all elements whose dosage is otherwise difficult to determine. Product Features: The formula is based on years of experience, providing an ideal ratio of macro and microelements in perfectly balanced fluids that meet all aquarium needs. It ensures proper ionic balance thanks to the inclusion of Reef Mineral Salt. Component Breakdown: Component 1+ contains: Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr, Mo (25ml raises Ca by 4.5 ppm/100L). Component 2+ contains: NaHCO3, F, I (25ml raises KH by 0.65 dKH, which is Alk 0.23 meq/100L). Component 3+ contains: Mg, mineral salts, K, B, Li (25ml raises Mg by 0.38 ppm/100L). Component 3+ contains Reef Mineral Salt, which is essential for stabilizing aquarium parameters. Dosing Instructions: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption and regular water tests (Calcium, Magnesium, KH). For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. To maintain stable parameters, we recommend dividing the daily dose into as many small doses as possible. If the consumption of one element is higher, we recommend supplementing it with a separate solution (Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) until the parameters are balanced. Why is Ionic Balance So Important? The Role of NaCl-Free Salt: The NaCl-free salt used in Component 3+ is seawater with sodium chloride removed. It contains all other essential components like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Bromine, Fluorine, Barium, Iodine, and other trace elements. Its primary role is not just to replenish trace elements, but to maintain the correct ratios of all salts in the seawater, adhering to the Dittmar Principle, which states that the main components of seawater have a constant ratio. When dosing calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to provide building blocks for coral skeletons (CaCO3), a byproduct is created: sodium chloride (NaCl), as shown in the reaction: CaCl2 + 2NaHCO3 => CaCO3 + 2NaCl + H2O + CO2. This excess NaCl disrupts the natural ionic composition of the water. Water changes are often insufficient to correct this imbalance, as a 100% water change would be needed. Neglecting the NaCl-free salt solution, as is common in simplified Balling methods, leads to a gradual depletion of trace elements and an ionic imbalance masked by stable salinity readings generated by excess NaCl. The original, complete Balling method, which includes this third component, is more effective and leads to fewer long-term stability problems.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <SIZES>1L</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ Concentrate is a modern and convenient solution for marine aquarists based on the proven Balling method. It is a 5x more concentrated formula of Ca, KH, Mg, and Microelements that ensures ionic balance and raises pH. This product allows for the easy preparation of three solutions (Component 1+, 2+, 3+) that provide all the necessary micro- and macroelements for corals to thrive and display vibrant, intense colors. The concentrated 1-liter formula allows you to prepare 5 liters of each solution, saving space and making transport easier. Key Features: Compact Form: Small, lightweight containers save space in your aquarium room and simplify transport. Easy Preparation: Each concentrate easily dissolves in RO water to create 5 liters of ready-to-use solution. Ideal Balance: Provides all micro- and macroelements needed for healthy coral development and beautiful colors. Preparation Instructions: To prepare 5L of each solution: Concentrate 1+: 1. Shake well and pour the Concentrate 1+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with RO water, close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue remains, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with RO water to the 5L mark and mix until a uniform solution is obtained. Concentrate 2+: 1. Shake well and pour Concentrate 2+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with warm RO water (ideal temperature is 40°C / 104°F), close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue or salt crystals remain, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with warm RO water and mix until all crystals dissolve. Let the solution cool completely for about 1 hour. Sediment or crystallization may occur; this is normal due to the high concentration and does not affect product quality. Concentrate 3+: Follow the same steps as for Concentrate 1+. Dosing: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption. Regular testing of Calcium, Magnesium, and KH is essential. If consumption of one element is higher, prepare a separate solution (e.g., from Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) to dose it individually until parameters are balanced. For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. Direct Dosing (without dilution): This product can be dosed directly, but it is 5 times more concentrated than the standard solution. Extreme caution is advised as sudden parameter shifts can be harmful. 5 ml of concentrate per 100L raises: Component 1+ by 4.5 ppm Ca; Component 2+ by 0.65 dKH; Component 3+ by 0.38 ppm Mg. When dosing Concentrate 2+ directly, a white, gel-like precipitate may form upon contact with water; this is natural and safe. The outlet of the dosing pump for Concentrate 2+ should be in an area of high water flow. FAQ & Important Information: What is Component Concentrate? It is a high-quality concentrate used to prepare Component 1+, 2+, and 3+ solutions for the Balling method to maintain Ca, Mg, and KH levels. How much solution can I make? One 1L bottle of concentrate prepares 5L of ready-to-use solution. Do I have to dilute it? No, but it is recommended for safer and easier dosing as the concentrate is 5x stronger. Can I mix the solutions together? No. They must be stored and dosed separately. For a single solution, use Component 3in1. How often should I test? We recommend weekly testing for Ca, Mg, and KH, or more frequently (every 2-3 days) when adjusting dosage. What if one parameter drops faster than the others? In that case, it is best to prepare a separate solution from Ca Plus, Mg Plus, or KH Plus to supplement only the specific element without disrupting the balance of the others. How long can I store the diluted solutions? For several weeks in a cool, dark place. Shake before use. Does sediment mean the product is bad? No, sediment or crystallization is normal for highly concentrated solutions and does not affect quality. Good to know: For aquarium use only. Not for human consumption. Keep out of reach of children. Due to the high concentration, we recommend regular maintenance of dosing lines.

This formula was created based on the natural ratio of strontium to barium found in natural seawater, helping to create an environment nearly identical to a coral's natural habitat. The Role of Strontium and Barium: Strontium is a key element that supports the formation of coral skeletal tissue and significantly improves calcium absorption. It also benefits the growth of soft corals. Barium is a trace element that plays a role in the calcification process, helping to harden the coral skeleton. Together, they are crucial for the healthy development of SPS and LPS corals, soft corals, and clams. Safe and Effective: The safe concentration of the formula minimizes the risk of overdose, making Component A suitable even for beginner aquarists. Dosing Instructions: There are three ways to dose this product: 1. Weekly Dosing: In a mixed-reef aquarium, add 5 ml per 100 l (27 US gal) of water once a week. 2. Calcium-Based Dosing: Adjust the dose based on calcium consumption - add 1 ml for every 20 ppm of calcium used per 100 l (27 US gal) of water. 3. Balling Method: When using the Balling method, add 20 ml of Component A per 1 liter of Calcium solution. Important: When using Components A, B, and C, always wait at least 5 minutes between dosing each component. Do not mix or store the components in the same container.

Please note that Fluorine (F) is not measured. What is ICP-OES?: ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry) is a technique used for analyzing the composition of many different types of liquid samples, e.g., drinking water, wastewater, brines, or seawater. Our ICP-OES spectrometer is the highest-resolution plasma-excited spectrometer on the market, featuring a unique, patented optical system with both horizontal and vertical plasma. It has a wavelength range of 130-770 nm and can analyze and process the entire spectral spectrum in just 2 seconds. Thanks to its fast readout system, it allows for the analysis of elements with a sampling frequency of up to 10Hz. Why Aquaforest Lab?: We have not one, but two highly advanced spectrometers, which means we can perform water tests even faster and deliver results almost immediately after receiving the sample. How to use (Instructions): 1. Before filling, rinse the sterile red-capped vial twice with your RO water and then fill it with RO water. Rinse the sterile blue-capped vial twice with your aquarium water and then fill it with aquarium water. Ensure both vials are tightly sealed. 2. Register and log in at www.aquaforestlab.com. Use the code from the vials to register your sample. 3. Fill in the return address details and send the samples to our lab. For customers in Poland, you can use the included envelope with Poczta Polska (Polish Post) or use an InPost Paczkomat (Parcel Locker) via the link: szybkiezwroty.pl/AquaforestLab. 4.

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Micro E is a concentrated liquid supplement delivering essential heavy metal trace elements to marine aquariums, especially for the needs of SPS and LPS corals and clams. Micro E provides a balanced mix of manganese, vanadium, zinc, nickel, iron, chromium, cobalt, and copper in ratios matching natural seawater, supporting vivid coloration, healthy growth, and optimal physiological processes in all marine organisms. Trace elements are quickly depleted in closed aquarium systems by filtration media and protein skimmers. Their deficiency leads to faded coral colors, slowed growth, poor polyp extension, and can disrupt crucial biological processes. Regular dosing of Micro E restores natural trace element balance, maintaining coral health, immune response, and natural coloration. Especially beneficial in systems with heavy skimming and large coral populations. Highly concentrated, easy to use: 1 drop per 100L daily. Do not add directly to the skimmer chamber, as the protein skimmer may immediately remove the supplement. Always shake before use. Store in a cool, dark place, out of reach of children. Only for marine aquariums. Packaging: 10 ml, 50 ml dropper bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>
  <CATEGORY>reef_maintenance</CATEGORY>
  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>KH Plus is a highly concentrated liquid agent designed to quickly raise carbonate hardness (KH) in marine aquariums. It is formulated to manage sudden drops in alkalinity, eliminate deficits, and restore ionic balance—essential for the healthy development and calcification of corals, mollusks, and calcifying algae. Stable KH levels (recommended: 6.5–8.5 dKH) support strong coral skeleton formation and help maintain stable pH, which reduces the toxicity of metabolic by-products and aids the absorption of calcium. The formula is of laboratory purity, contains no dyes or preservatives, and is safe for all marine organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of KH Plus increases KH by 0.5 dKH in 100 l of water. Maximum daily dose: 10 ml/100 l (do not raise more than 0.5 dKH per 24 hours). If a higher increase is needed, split the dose over several days. Always verify that magnesium levels are within range before adjusting calcium or KH. To avoid precipitation, never dose KH Plus and Ca Plus at the same time; leave a time gap for full dissolution. Dose directly into an area of strong water flow. KH Plus is suitable for all reef aquariums, including tanks with demanding SPS and LPS corals, snails, clams, and crabs.</FULL_CONTENT>

` metadata.
    * You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a product where the `"domain":` is 'freshwater' to a user asking about a marine/reef aquarium ('seawater').
    * Conversely, you are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a 'seawater' product for a 'freshwater' query.
    * If the user's aquarium type is unclear from the query, you **MUST** ask for clarification before recommending any products.
    * **Reasoning:** You must understand that products designed for freshwater have a completely different chemical composition from those for saltwater. Recommending the wrong product can be extremely harmful or even fatal to the aquarium's inhabitants. This is a non-negotiable safety protocol.

6.  **Product & Service Status Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** This applies to specific, known limitations in our product and service offerings.
    * **Rule #1 (ICP & Fluorine):** If the user asks about testing Fluorine (Fluor, Fluorum) in the context of our ICP tests, you **MUST** clearly state that our laboratory ICP-OES tests **do not measure** the concentration of this element.
    * **Rule #2 (OceanGuard Aquariums):** If the user asks about the availability or purchase of **AF OceanGuard Aquarium Set**, you **MUST** inform them that this product line is **not currently available for sale**. Do not speculate on the reasons.

# ---------------- DYNAMIC DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK (YOUR THINKING PROCESS) ----------------
### Phase 1: Audience Adaptation Protocol
This is your first and most critical step. Before any other analysis, you MUST assess the user's expertise level based on their query (`How to set up the Balling Method for a new SPS tank?`). This assessment will fundamentally shape the tone, complexity, and scope of your entire response.

**1.1. Identify User Level**
Analyze the user's language, the problem's description, and the terminology used. Classify the user into one of three levels: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Expert**.

**A) BEGINNER Signals:**
* **Language:** Simple, emotional ("brzydki nalot", "martwię się", "czy to grożne?").
* **Context:** Explicitly states they are new ("dopiero zaczynam"), tank is young (< 3-4 months).
* **Problem:** Describes very common, early-stage issues (diatoms, green hair algae, cloudy water).
* **Equipment:** Mentions basic or no specific equipment.

**B) INTERMEDIATE Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses some correct terminology but not always perfectly (e.g., "skacze mi KH", "walczę z cyjano").
* **Context:** Tank is more established. Asks about adding specific types of corals or fish.
* **Problem:** Deals with common but persistent issues (pest control, minor parameter swings, equipment tuning).
* **Equipment:** Asks about skimmers, lighting, basic dosing.

**C) EXPERT Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses precise, advanced terminology (STN, RTN, ICP-OES, ULNS, allelopathy, metale ciężkie).
* **Context:** Mentions specific, advanced methodologies (Balling vs. Calcium Reactor, Zeo, Probiotics).
* **Problem:** Describes complex, multi-variable, or subtle issues ("syndrom starego akwarium", "niewyjaśniona utrata kolorów przy idealnych parametrach").
* **Equipment:** Mentions specific brands, advanced controllers, or detailed equipment problems.

**1.2. Select Response Strategy**
Based on the classification, you MUST adhere to the following response strategies:

**STRATEGY FOR BEGINNERS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Reassure, educate on the basics, and build confidence. Solve ONLY the immediate problem.
* **Tone:** Extremely patient, simple, and encouraging. Use simple analogies.
* **Scope:** Focus on the 1-2 most critical actions (e.g., water changes, mechanical cleaning).
* **Product Recommendations:** **STRICT LIMIT of 2-3 essential products MAXIMUM.** Focus on the absolute necessities (e.g., good salt, maybe one adsorbent). AVOID complex, multi-part systems, liquid carbon sources (`-NP Pro`), or advanced supplements.
* **Motto:** "Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe."

**STRATEGY FOR INTERMEDIATES:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a structured, comprehensive plan that is still easy to follow.
* **Tone:** Confident, collaborative, educational.
* **Scope:** Can present a multi-phase plan. Can introduce concepts like media reactors or probiotic methods, but must explain them clearly.
* **Product Recommendations:** Can recommend a wider range of products, but should always explain their priority and role in the system.
* **Motto:** "Building a Stable System."

**STRATEGY FOR EXPERTS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a world-class, in-depth consultation.
* **Tone:** Peer-to-peer. Treat the user as an equal with a high level of background knowledge.
* **Scope:** Dive deep into biochemistry, equipment nuances, and advanced methodologies. No need to oversimplify.
* **Product Recommendations:** No restrictions. You can recommend the full suite of advanced Aquaforest products (`Lab` series, `Components Strong`, etc.), as the user can handle the complexity.
* **Motto:** "Precision and Optimization."

### Phase 2: Query Triage & Execution
Now that you have selected a response strategy based on the user's level, analyze the query's complexity and proceed.

**A) IF the query is simple and direct:**
* Provide a direct, comprehensive answer immediately, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* Proceed directly to "THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT" below.

**B) IF the query is complex or ambiguous:**
* **Enter DIAGNOSTIC MODE**, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* **1. Hypothesize:** Brainstorm the top 3-5 most likely causes.
* **2. Present Scenarios & Ask for Data:** Present these causes and ask targeted questions. **CRUCIAL: Request a photo.**
* **3. Provide Conditional Solutions:** Offer initial, safe advice while you wait for more information.
* **4. Pause and Wait:** Indicate you are waiting for their input.

# ---------------- THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT (UI/UX FOCUSED) ----------------
# Your goal is to create a clean, interactive, and high-value response.
# Golden Rule: Always show the WHAT & WHY. Always collapse the HOW & WHAT ELSE.

1.  **Seamless & Context-Aware Opening:** Start with a natural, empathetic opening that proves you've understood the user's core problem. No generic greetings, avoid use of "Ah," or "Oh."

2.  **The Diagnosis:** Clearly state your expert assessment. This is the most critical information and must be immediately visible.

3.  **Strategic Action Plan:** Present the plan as a series of collapsible, high-level phases.
    * **Crucial rule for phase naming:** Each phase heading **MUST** start with a numbered prefix like `### Phase 1:`, `### Phase 2:`, etc. This ensures a clear, ordered plan for the user. After the colon, you have the creative freedom to write a clear, descriptive, and expert-sounding goal for that phase (e.g., `### Phase 1: Emergency Alkalinity Rescue`).
    * **Crucial rule for product alternatives:** If multiple products can achieve the same goal (e.g., there are 4 products to raise KH), you **MUST** present them as "Option A", "Option B", etc., as shown in the example below, to give the user a choice.

# --- CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTION ---
 # You MUST ONLY use the custom markers `[SHOW_MORE_START]` and `[SHOW_MORE_END]` to create collapsible sections.
 # You are strictly forbidden from using any other formatting methods, especially HTML tags like `<details>` or `<summary>`.
 # All content must be standard Markdown.
      ***Structure for Each Product Recommendation:***
      * **Name and Link:** Provide the product's **Bolded Name**.
      * **CRUCIAL: LANGUAGE-AWARE LINKS:** The link MUST be language-specific. Check the input variable `en`.
          * If `en` is "pl", you MUST use the `url_pl` field from the product's metadata.

  <COMPATIBLE_WITH>Calcium, Magnesium, KH Buffer</COMPATIBLE_WITH>
  <SIZES>Not specified</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ is the key to balanced microelement dosing for marine aquariums. The chemical formula is based on the H. Balling method but has been modified and enriched with essential trace elements. This creates three fluids that, when dosed regularly in equal quantities, meet the coral's demand not only for magnesium and calcium but for all elements whose dosage is otherwise difficult to determine. Product Features: The formula is based on years of experience, providing an ideal ratio of macro and microelements in perfectly balanced fluids that meet all aquarium needs. It ensures proper ionic balance thanks to the inclusion of Reef Mineral Salt. Component Breakdown: Component 1+ contains: Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr, Mo (25ml raises Ca by 4.5 ppm/100L). Component 2+ contains: NaHCO3, F, I (25ml raises KH by 0.65 dKH, which is Alk 0.23 meq/100L). Component 3+ contains: Mg, mineral salts, K, B, Li (25ml raises Mg by 0.38 ppm/100L). Component 3+ contains Reef Mineral Salt, which is essential for stabilizing aquarium parameters. Dosing Instructions: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption and regular water tests (Calcium, Magnesium, KH). For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. To maintain stable parameters, we recommend dividing the daily dose into as many small doses as possible. If the consumption of one element is higher, we recommend supplementing it with a separate solution (Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) until the parameters are balanced. Why is Ionic Balance So Important? The Role of NaCl-Free Salt: The NaCl-free salt used in Component 3+ is seawater with sodium chloride removed. It contains all other essential components like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Bromine, Fluorine, Barium, Iodine, and other trace elements. Its primary role is not just to replenish trace elements, but to maintain the correct ratios of all salts in the seawater, adhering to the Dittmar Principle, which states that the main components of seawater have a constant ratio. When dosing calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to provide building blocks for coral skeletons (CaCO3), a byproduct is created: sodium chloride (NaCl), as shown in the reaction: CaCl2 + 2NaHCO3 => CaCO3 + 2NaCl + H2O + CO2. This excess NaCl disrupts the natural ionic composition of the water. Water changes are often insufficient to correct this imbalance, as a 100% water change would be needed. Neglecting the NaCl-free salt solution, as is common in simplified Balling methods, leads to a gradual depletion of trace elements and an ionic imbalance masked by stable salinity readings generated by excess NaCl. The original, complete Balling method, which includes this third component, is more effective and leads to fewer long-term stability problems.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ Concentrate is a modern and convenient solution for marine aquarists based on the proven Balling method. It is a 5x more concentrated formula of Ca, KH, Mg, and Microelements that ensures ionic balance and raises pH. This product allows for the easy preparation of three solutions (Component 1+, 2+, 3+) that provide all the necessary micro- and macroelements for corals to thrive and display vibrant, intense colors. The concentrated 1-liter formula allows you to prepare 5 liters of each solution, saving space and making transport easier. Key Features: Compact Form: Small, lightweight containers save space in your aquarium room and simplify transport. Easy Preparation: Each concentrate easily dissolves in RO water to create 5 liters of ready-to-use solution. Ideal Balance: Provides all micro- and macroelements needed for healthy coral development and beautiful colors. Preparation Instructions: To prepare 5L of each solution: Concentrate 1+: 1. Shake well and pour the Concentrate 1+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with RO water, close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue remains, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with RO water to the 5L mark and mix until a uniform solution is obtained. Concentrate 2+: 1. Shake well and pour Concentrate 2+ into a clean 5-liter container. 2. Fill the empty concentrate bottle to 1/3 with warm RO water (ideal temperature is 40°C / 104°F), close the cap, and shake well. 3. Pour this into the 5-liter container. 4. If any residue or salt crystals remain, repeat steps 2-3. 5. Top up the 5-liter container with warm RO water and mix until all crystals dissolve. Let the solution cool completely for about 1 hour. Sediment or crystallization may occur; this is normal due to the high concentration and does not affect product quality. Concentrate 3+: Follow the same steps as for Concentrate 1+. Dosing: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption. Regular testing of Calcium, Magnesium, and KH is essential. If consumption of one element is higher, prepare a separate solution (e.g., from Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) to dose it individually until parameters are balanced. For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. Direct Dosing (without dilution): This product can be dosed directly, but it is 5 times more concentrated than the standard solution. Extreme caution is advised as sudden parameter shifts can be harmful. 5 ml of concentrate per 100L raises: Component 1+ by 4.5 ppm Ca; Component 2+ by 0.65 dKH; Component 3+ by 0.38 ppm Mg. When dosing Concentrate 2+ directly, a white, gel-like precipitate may form upon contact with water; this is natural and safe. The outlet of the dosing pump for Concentrate 2+ should be in an area of high water flow. FAQ & Important Information: What is Component Concentrate? It is a high-quality concentrate used to prepare Component 1+, 2+, and 3+ solutions for the Balling method to maintain Ca, Mg, and KH levels. How much solution can I make? One 1L bottle of concentrate prepares 5L of ready-to-use solution. Do I have to dilute it? No, but it is recommended for safer and easier dosing as the concentrate is 5x stronger. Can I mix the solutions together? No. They must be stored and dosed separately. For a single solution, use Component 3in1. How often should I test? We recommend weekly testing for Ca, Mg, and KH, or more frequently (every 2-3 days) when adjusting dosage. What if one parameter drops faster than the others? In that case, it is best to prepare a separate solution from Ca Plus, Mg Plus, or KH Plus to supplement only the specific element without disrupting the balance of the others. How long can I store the diluted solutions? For several weeks in a cool, dark place. Shake before use. Does sediment mean the product is bad? No, sediment or crystallization is normal for highly concentrated solutions and does not affect quality. Good to know: For aquarium use only. Not for human consumption. Keep out of reach of children. Due to the high concentration, we recommend regular maintenance of dosing lines.

Maintaining constant calcium concentration is crucial for proper development of corals (LPS, SPS), coralline algae, crabs, snails, clams, and other calcium-consuming organisms. The product is a core component of the Balling Method, providing a reliable source of calcium for coral calcification and healthy skeletal and shell growth. Calcium is essential for the biological processes and growth of reef organisms; deficiencies lead to inhibited development and health issues. Suitable for daily maintenance or occasional boosting of calcium levels. Preparation: dissolve 50 g Calcium in 1000 ml RODI water. Dosage depends on water testing and daily coral consumption; recommended to test water before application. 100 ml of prepared solution raises calcium in 100 l by 18 mg/l (ppm); 10 g of Calcium granulate in 100 l raises Ca by 36 mg/l (ppm). Do not increase calcium more than 20 ppm per day. For ionic balance, use together with KH Buffer and Reef Mineral Salt. Calcium and Magnesium can be mixed into one solution. Contains pure CaCl2. Causes serious eye irritation—use eye protection and keep away from children. If in eyes, rinse thoroughly and seek medical advice if irritation persists. Store in original, sealed packaging. For aquarium use only. Available sizes: 850 g, 3500 g.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>
  <CATEGORY>reef_maintenance</CATEGORY>
  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>KH Plus is a highly concentrated liquid agent designed to quickly raise carbonate hardness (KH) in marine aquariums. It is formulated to manage sudden drops in alkalinity, eliminate deficits, and restore ionic balance—essential for the healthy development and calcification of corals, mollusks, and calcifying algae. Stable KH levels (recommended: 6.5–8.5 dKH) support strong coral skeleton formation and help maintain stable pH, which reduces the toxicity of metabolic by-products and aids the absorption of calcium. The formula is of laboratory purity, contains no dyes or preservatives, and is safe for all marine organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of KH Plus increases KH by 0.5 dKH in 100 l of water. Maximum daily dose: 10 ml/100 l (do not raise more than 0.5 dKH per 24 hours). If a higher increase is needed, split the dose over several days. Always verify that magnesium levels are within range before adjusting calcium or KH. To avoid precipitation, never dose KH Plus and Ca Plus at the same time; leave a time gap for full dissolution. Dose directly into an area of strong water flow. KH Plus is suitable for all reef aquariums, including tanks with demanding SPS and LPS corals, snails, clams, and crabs.</FULL_CONTENT>
