  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest NO3 - Nitrate Test Kit is a fast, precise drop test for measuring nitrate (NO3) levels in marine aquariums. Nitrate is the end product of biological filtration, and high concentrations cause unwanted algae blooms and stress for sensitive corals, especially SPS. Accurate nitrate measurement is crucial for water quality, early detection of nutrient imbalance, and maintaining optimal NO3 range (2-5 mg/l) for healthy reef tanks. The kit includes all reagents and tools for 40 tests: A-NO3 reagent container, B-NO3 bottle, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 2 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and instruction manual. Results are read in just a few minutes via a clear color scale. Regular monitoring helps identify overfeeding, skimmer failure, or incomplete tank cycling, and allows you to quickly adjust feeding or filtration before algae outbreaks occur. Designed specifically for marine tanks, with precision at low NO3 levels often missed by freshwater test kits. Store in a cool, dry place away from light. Perform tests in daylight for best accuracy, avoiding colored surroundings or incandescent light.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>
  <CATEGORY>reef_maintenance</CATEGORY>
  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>There are three main filtration methods in aquariums: biological, chemical, and mechanical. Biological filtration is the most important for aquarium health. It relies on nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira) that convert toxic ammonia/ammonium into nitrite and then into less harmful nitrate, which is removed by water changes or denitrifying bacteria. Key bio-media: ceramic rings, AF Bio Sand, Life Bio Fil, filter sponges, bio balls. Chemical filtration (optional, but helpful) removes specific dissolved substances: activated carbon eliminates chlorine, odors, discoloration; zeolite absorbs ammonia; resins remove phosphates, heavy metals, nitrate. Products: Phosphate Minus, Zeo Mix, filter resins. Chemical media should be replaced regularly. Mechanical filtration physically traps visible debris (uneaten food, plant parts, dust, fish waste) using filter pads, sponges, or filter socks. Finer media provide clearer water but need frequent cleaning. Mechanical and chemical filtration support biological filtration, not replace it. When cleaning, avoid using tap water or chemicals on bio-media to preserve beneficial bacteria. Filter choice depends on tank size, livestock, maintenance routine, and filtration goals.</FULL_TEXT>

This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>
  <CATEGORY>reef_maintenance</CATEGORY>
  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>There are three main filtration methods in aquariums: biological, chemical, and mechanical. Biological filtration is the most important for aquarium health. It relies on nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira) that convert toxic ammonia/ammonium into nitrite and then into less harmful nitrate, which is removed by water changes or denitrifying bacteria. Key bio-media: ceramic rings, AF Bio Sand, Life Bio Fil, filter sponges, bio balls. Chemical filtration (optional, but helpful) removes specific dissolved substances: activated carbon eliminates chlorine, odors, discoloration; zeolite absorbs ammonia; resins remove phosphates, heavy metals, nitrate. Products: Phosphate Minus, Zeo Mix, filter resins. Chemical media should be replaced regularly. Mechanical filtration physically traps visible debris (uneaten food, plant parts, dust, fish waste) using filter pads, sponges, or filter socks. Finer media provide clearer water but need frequent cleaning. Mechanical and chemical filtration support biological filtration, not replace it. When cleaning, avoid using tap water or chemicals on bio-media to preserve beneficial bacteria. Filter choice depends on tank size, livestock, maintenance routine, and filtration goals.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

 or your core knowledge. This is the highest priority check.

Examples: Questions about using AF products with competitor's products, unlisted chemical interactions, advice for treating diseased animals, use with non-standard or DIY equipment. If you are not 100% certain, choose this path.

full_plan: You are certain of the answer, AND the user has provided the final, critical piece of information (e.g., water parameters, a photo) that you were waiting for. Their query allows you to confirm a complex diagnosis and present a complete, multi-phase strategic plan.

concise_answer: You are certain of the answer, AND the user is asking a simple, specific question for clarification about the previous context. This does not require a new, full strategic plan.

Examples: "How much of that second product should I dose?", "And what about AF Build?", "Is it safe for shrimp?", "OK, where can I buy it?".

<<< STEP 2: SYNTHESIS & DIAGNOSIS (IF APPLICABLE) >>>
If your triage decision is full_plan or concise_answer, proceed with the following:
Synthesize All Information: Review the user's new answer in the full context of the previous conversation.

Conclude the Diagnosis: Based on the synthesis, confidently confirm which of your initial hypotheses was correct. State it clearly.

Acknowledge & Discard (Optional): Briefly mention why other hypotheses were ruled out.
