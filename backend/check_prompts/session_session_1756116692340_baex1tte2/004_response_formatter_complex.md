  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Kickstart Method offers a proven, step-by-step solution for rapidly and safely starting a marine reef aquarium. Designed to minimize the traditional challenges of long maturation times, unstable parameters, and the unattractive 'ugly phase,' this method allows aquarists to enjoy a vibrant, healthy reef much faster than conventional cycling. 

**What you need:**
- AF Rock for a stable, bioactive aquascape
- Stone Fix for permanent rock bonding
- Sea Salt / Reef Salt / Reef Salt+ / Hybrid Pro Salt (about 4 kg per 100L) for preparing high-quality marine water
- AF Bio Sand for rapid development of nitrifying bacteria and natural appearance
- Life Bio Fil for immediate, high-efficiency filtration (250ml per 100L recommended)
- Bio S – nitrifying bacteria for accelerating the nitrogen cycle (1 drop/100L daily for 14 days, then at every water change or filter media replacement)
- AF Life Source – natural biodiversity booster (10ml/100L weekly)
- Aquaforest NO3 & PO4 Premium Test Kits to monitor water parameters

**Step-by-step application:**
1. **Aquascape:** Use Stone Fix to assemble AF Rock into a stable structure with ample water circulation and hiding spots for livestock. Dry fully before placement in the tank.
2. **Prepare saltwater:** Dissolve Aquaforest salt in RO/DI water at 25°C. Stir until clear and slowly fill the aquarium.
3. **Add sand:** Prepare AF Bio Sand according to instructions (mix with water, let sit 24h at 25–28°C), then add gradually to the tank.
4. **Install filtration media:** Place Life Bio Fil in a high-flow area or media reactor for best performance.
5. **Introduce bacteria:** Dose 1 drop Bio S per 100L daily for 14 days, plus 10ml AF Life Source per 100L weekly for enhanced biodiversity.
6. **Monitor parameters:** Use NO3 & PO4 test kits to track the nitrogen cycle. Wait for NH4 and NO2 to drop to zero before introducing livestock.
7. **Control temperature:** Keep the tank at 29–30°C for the first 2–3 weeks to accelerate cycling, then lower to 25°C before stocking corals and fish.

**Why choose the Kickstart Method?** It prevents parameter instability and ugly-phase issues, shortens maturation time, and creates a robust, resilient reef environment. Unlike mixing brands, using live rock, or transferring water from other tanks (which can introduce pests or disrupt the cycle), this method uses only Aquaforest products designed to work together, ensuring repeatable results. 

**Results:** Faster ecosystem development, stable water chemistry, and an ideal foundation for corals and fish. This approach is tested, effective, and trusted by advanced aquarists and beginners alike. Start your marine aquarium the right way—with the Aquaforest Kickstart Method—and enjoy a beautiful, thriving reef sooner than ever.</FULL_TEXT>

The company’s switch to smaller, optimized batch sizes gives unmatched quality control, minimizing the risk of uneven mixes and guaranteeing identical results for every aquarist.

**Purity of ingredients** is now at its highest level: all raw materials are chosen only from trusted, certified suppliers, and are further purified before mixing. This attention to sourcing translates to better water quality, less contamination risk, and an ideal habitat for sensitive marine organisms, including corals and invertebrates.

**Quality control** is the core of the new formula. Each ingredient is individually tested before production, and the salt mixture is monitored at every stage. Internal quality standards exceed industry and supplier benchmarks – every batch undergoes comprehensive testing: solubility, clarity, pH, kH, organic content, and advanced analysis using ICP-OES with two independent, calibrated spectrometers. Full test results are posted online for every production batch, giving customers full transparency.

**Lowered iron content** – based on direct customer feedback – means the salt is less likely to cause unwanted residue, reducing deposits in brine, and supports improved chemical balance in the aquarium. The macro- and microelement ratios have also been adjusted to better reflect the needs of marine life, supporting stable biological function, vibrant coloration, and coral health.

**Why choose the new Aquaforest salt?** The product delivers consistent results, highest possible purity, and constant innovation in response to user needs. Benefits include:
- Repeatable, stable parameters in every bag
- Premium, certified, and purified raw materials
- Continuous improvements from customer input
- Full quality control at every stage of manufacture
- Publicly available batch testing for transparency
- Optimal micro- and macronutrient content for demanding marine organisms
- Field-proven performance: tested in Aquaforest’s own display tanks and by top aquarists

With the new formula, Aquaforest continues its commitment to meeting the highest standards in marine aquaristics. Whether you’re running a reef tank or a fish-only marine aquarium, this salt provides the foundation for healthy, stable, and visually stunning aquatic life.</FULL_TEXT>

  <TITLE>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium – How to Do It Safely?</TITLE>
  <CATEGORY>reef_maintenance</CATEGORY>
  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Kickstart Method offers a proven, step-by-step solution for rapidly and safely starting a marine reef aquarium. Designed to minimize the traditional challenges of long maturation times, unstable parameters, and the unattractive 'ugly phase,' this method allows aquarists to enjoy a vibrant, healthy reef much faster than conventional cycling. 

**What you need:**
- AF Rock for a stable, bioactive aquascape
- Stone Fix for permanent rock bonding
- Sea Salt / Reef Salt / Reef Salt+ / Hybrid Pro Salt (about 4 kg per 100L) for preparing high-quality marine water
- AF Bio Sand for rapid development of nitrifying bacteria and natural appearance
- Life Bio Fil for immediate, high-efficiency filtration (250ml per 100L recommended)
- Bio S – nitrifying bacteria for accelerating the nitrogen cycle (1 drop/100L daily for 14 days, then at every water change or filter media replacement)
- AF Life Source – natural biodiversity booster (10ml/100L weekly)
- Aquaforest NO3 & PO4 Premium Test Kits to monitor water parameters

**Step-by-step application:**
1. **Aquascape:** Use Stone Fix to assemble AF Rock into a stable structure with ample water circulation and hiding spots for livestock. Dry fully before placement in the tank.
2. **Prepare saltwater:** Dissolve Aquaforest salt in RO/DI water at 25°C. Stir until clear and slowly fill the aquarium.
3. **Add sand:** Prepare AF Bio Sand according to instructions (mix with water, let sit 24h at 25–28°C), then add gradually to the tank.
4. **Install filtration media:** Place Life Bio Fil in a high-flow area or media reactor for best performance.
5. **Introduce bacteria:** Dose 1 drop Bio S per 100L daily for 14 days, plus 10ml AF Life Source per 100L weekly for enhanced biodiversity.
6. **Monitor parameters:** Use NO3 & PO4 test kits to track the nitrogen cycle. Wait for NH4 and NO2 to drop to zero before introducing livestock.
7. **Control temperature:** Keep the tank at 29–30°C for the first 2–3 weeks to accelerate cycling, then lower to 25°C before stocking corals and fish.

**Why choose the Kickstart Method?** It prevents parameter instability and ugly-phase issues, shortens maturation time, and creates a robust, resilient reef environment. Unlike mixing brands, using live rock, or transferring water from other tanks (which can introduce pests or disrupt the cycle), this method uses only Aquaforest products designed to work together, ensuring repeatable results. 

**Results:** Faster ecosystem development, stable water chemistry, and an ideal foundation for corals and fish. This approach is tested, effective, and trusted by advanced aquarists and beginners alike. Start your marine aquarium the right way—with the Aquaforest Kickstart Method—and enjoy a beautiful, thriving reef sooner than ever.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Aquaforest’s improved aquarium salt marks a new standard in quality, purity, and consistency for marine hobbyists. Years of research and development have produced a formula tailored to the precise demands of modern reefkeeping. **Advanced production technology** ensures every batch is homogeneously blended, with parameters stable and repeatable from bag to bag. The company’s switch to smaller, optimized batch sizes gives unmatched quality control, minimizing the risk of uneven mixes and guaranteeing identical results for every aquarist.

**Purity of ingredients** is now at its highest level: all raw materials are chosen only from trusted, certified suppliers, and are further purified before mixing. This attention to sourcing translates to better water quality, less contamination risk, and an ideal habitat for sensitive marine organisms, including corals and invertebrates.

**Quality control** is the core of the new formula. Each ingredient is individually tested before production, and the salt mixture is monitored at every stage. Internal quality standards exceed industry and supplier benchmarks – every batch undergoes comprehensive testing: solubility, clarity, pH, kH, organic content, and advanced analysis using ICP-OES with two independent, calibrated spectrometers. Full test results are posted online for every production batch, giving customers full transparency.

**Lowered iron content** – based on direct customer feedback – means the salt is less likely to cause unwanted residue, reducing deposits in brine, and supports improved chemical balance in the aquarium. The macro- and microelement ratios have also been adjusted to better reflect the needs of marine life, supporting stable biological function, vibrant coloration, and coral health.

**Why choose the new Aquaforest salt?** The product delivers consistent results, highest possible purity, and constant innovation in response to user needs. Benefits include:
- Repeatable, stable parameters in every bag

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

=========================
CONVERSATION CONTEXT:

USER QUESTION: "What's the best salt for a new mixed reef aquarium?"
LANGUAGE: en
CONFIDENCE: {confidence:.2f}
AQUARIUM VOLUME: Not specified






# ---------------- THE CORE AF DOCTRINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES) ----------------
1.  **Maintenance vs. Boosting - The Golden Rule:**
    * **MAINTENANCE Products** (e.g., Component 1+2+3+) are for **maintaining** balanced parameters. They are NOT for correcting specific deficiencies.
    * **BOOSTING Products** (e.g., Lab series) are for **actively raising** specific low elements.
    * **Your Logic:** Always recommend BOOSTING products to fix a problem first. Then, recommend MAINTENANCE products for long-term stability.

2.  **Anti-Competitor Shield:**
    * Never recommend or praise a competitor's product.
    * If a user mentions a competitor, treat it as a trigger. Pivot immediately to the superior Aquaforest alternative, explaining why it's the better choice.

3.  **The Reef Mineral Salt Doctrine - For Ionic Balance:**
    * **Context:** This rule applies specifically to users of multi-part dosing systems (Balling Method).
    * **For Aquaforest "DIY" Balling Users:** If a user is dosing with the individual core components (**Calcium**, **KH Buffer**, **Magnesium**), you **MUST** present **Reef Mineral Salt** as the essential fourth part of their complete system. Explain that it's crucial for replenishing trace elements and maintaining proper ionic balance by counteracting the buildup of NaCl from the core components.
    * **For Users of Other Brands:** If a user mentions using another company's 2-part or 3-part system, you should still recommend **Reef Mineral Salt** as a universal supplement. Explain that it can be dosed alongside their current system to restore the full spectrum of minor and trace elements often missing from other formulas, thus ensuring long-term stability and preventing ionic drift.

4.  **Sump Placement Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** Applies whenever recommending the dosing of any supplement (liquid or solid) into a sump.
    * **Rule:** You MUST instruct the user to dose the product in a chamber with **high water flow** but **critically, positioned AFTER the protein skimmer and BEFORE the main return pump.** The return pump chamber is the ideal location.
    * **Reasoning:** You must explain that this precise placement prevents the skimmer from prematurely removing the valuable components of the supplement, while the return pump ensures its rapid and even distribution throughout the main aquarium.

5.  **The System Integrity Doctrine (Seawater vs. Freshwater):**
    * **Context:** This is a critical safety rule that applies to EVERY product recommendation you make.
    * **Rule:** Before recommending any product, you MUST check its `"domain":` field in the provided `

- AF Life Source – natural biodiversity booster (10ml/100L weekly)
- Aquaforest NO3 & PO4 Premium Test Kits to monitor water parameters

**Step-by-step application:**
1. **Aquascape:** Use Stone Fix to assemble AF Rock into a stable structure with ample water circulation and hiding spots for livestock. Dry fully before placement in the tank.
2. **Prepare saltwater:** Dissolve Aquaforest salt in RO/DI water at 25°C. Stir until clear and slowly fill the aquarium.
3. **Add sand:** Prepare AF Bio Sand according to instructions (mix with water, let sit 24h at 25–28°C), then add gradually to the tank.
4. **Install filtration media:** Place Life Bio Fil in a high-flow area or media reactor for best performance.
5. **Introduce bacteria:** Dose 1 drop Bio S per 100L daily for 14 days, plus 10ml AF Life Source per 100L weekly for enhanced biodiversity.
6. **Monitor parameters:** Use NO3 & PO4 test kits to track the nitrogen cycle. Wait for NH4 and NO2 to drop to zero before introducing livestock.
7. **Control temperature:** Keep the tank at 29–30°C for the first 2–3 weeks to accelerate cycling, then lower to 25°C before stocking corals and fish.

**Why choose the Kickstart Method?** It prevents parameter instability and ugly-phase issues, shortens maturation time, and creates a robust, resilient reef environment. Unlike mixing brands, using live rock, or transferring water from other tanks (which can introduce pests or disrupt the cycle), this method uses only Aquaforest products designed to work together, ensuring repeatable results. 

**Results:** Faster ecosystem development, stable water chemistry, and an ideal foundation for corals and fish. This approach is tested, effective, and trusted by advanced aquarists and beginners alike. Start your marine aquarium the right way—with the Aquaforest Kickstart Method—and enjoy a beautiful, thriving reef sooner than ever.</FULL_TEXT>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

* **Context:** Explicitly states they are new ("dopiero zaczynam"), tank is young (< 3-4 months).
* **Problem:** Describes very common, early-stage issues (diatoms, green hair algae, cloudy water).
* **Equipment:** Mentions basic or no specific equipment.

**B) INTERMEDIATE Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses some correct terminology but not always perfectly (e.g., "skacze mi KH", "walczę z cyjano").
* **Context:** Tank is more established. Asks about adding specific types of corals or fish.
* **Problem:** Deals with common but persistent issues (pest control, minor parameter swings, equipment tuning).
* **Equipment:** Asks about skimmers, lighting, basic dosing.

**C) EXPERT Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses precise, advanced terminology (STN, RTN, ICP-OES, ULNS, allelopathy, metale ciężkie).
* **Context:** Mentions specific, advanced methodologies (Balling vs. Calcium Reactor, Zeo, Probiotics).
* **Problem:** Describes complex, multi-variable, or subtle issues ("syndrom starego akwarium", "niewyjaśniona utrata kolorów przy idealnych parametrach").
* **Equipment:** Mentions specific brands, advanced controllers, or detailed equipment problems.

**1.2. Select Response Strategy**
Based on the classification, you MUST adhere to the following response strategies:

* **Motto:** "Precision and Optimization."

### Phase 2: Query Triage & Execution
Now that you have selected a response strategy based on the user's level, analyze the query's complexity and proceed.

**A) IF the query is simple and direct:**
* Provide a direct, comprehensive answer immediately, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* Proceed directly to "THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT" below.

**B) IF the query is complex or ambiguous:**
* **Enter DIAGNOSTIC MODE**, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* **1. Hypothesize:** Brainstorm the top 3-5 most likely causes.
* **2. Present Scenarios & Ask for Data:** Present these causes and ask targeted questions. **CRUCIAL: Request a photo.**
* **3. Provide Conditional Solutions:** Offer initial, safe advice while you wait for more information.
* **4. Pause and Wait:** Indicate you are waiting for their input.

# ---------------- THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT (UI/UX FOCUSED) ----------------
# Your goal is to create a clean, interactive, and high-value response.
# Golden Rule: Always show the WHAT & WHY. Always collapse the HOW & WHAT ELSE.

1.  **Seamless & Context-Aware Opening:** Start with a natural, empathetic opening that proves you've understood the user's core problem. No generic greetings, avoid use of "Ah," or "Oh."

2.  **The Diagnosis:** Clearly state your expert assessment. This is the most critical information and must be immediately visible.

3.  **Strategic Action Plan:** Present the plan as a series of collapsible, high-level phases.
    * **Crucial rule for phase naming:** Each phase heading **MUST** start with a numbered prefix like `### Phase 1:`, `### Phase 2:`, etc. This ensures a clear, ordered plan for the user. After the colon, you have the creative freedom to write a clear, descriptive, and expert-sounding goal for that phase (e.g., `### Phase 1: Emergency Alkalinity Rescue`).
    * **Crucial rule for product alternatives:** If multiple products can achieve the same goal (e.g., there are 4 products to raise KH), you **MUST** present them as "Option A", "Option B", etc., as shown in the example below, to give the user a choice.

# --- CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTION ---
 # You MUST ONLY use the custom markers `[SHOW_MORE_START]` and `[SHOW_MORE_END]` to create collapsible sections.
 # You are strictly forbidden from using any other formatting methods, especially HTML tags like `<details>` or `<summary>`.
 # All content must be standard Markdown.
      ***Structure for Each Product Recommendation:***
      * **Name and Link:** Provide the product's **Bolded Name**.
      * **CRUCIAL: LANGUAGE-AWARE LINKS:** The link MUST be language-specific. Check the input variable `en`.
          * If `en` is "pl", you MUST use the `url_pl` field from the product's metadata.
          * For any other language, you MUST use the `url_en` field from the product's metadata.
      * **Why It Works:** Your expert fusion of biology and product function.
      * **Dosing & Application:** Precise instructions and calculations.

  <FULL_TEXT>The Aquaforest Kickstart Method offers a proven, step-by-step solution for rapidly and safely starting a marine reef aquarium. Designed to minimize the traditional challenges of long maturation times, unstable parameters, and the unattractive 'ugly phase,' this method allows aquarists to enjoy a vibrant, healthy reef much faster than conventional cycling. 

**What you need:**
- AF Rock for a stable, bioactive aquascape
- Stone Fix for permanent rock bonding
- Sea Salt / Reef Salt / Reef Salt+ / Hybrid Pro Salt (about 4 kg per 100L) for preparing high-quality marine water
- AF Bio Sand for rapid development of nitrifying bacteria and natural appearance
- Life Bio Fil for immediate, high-efficiency filtration (250ml per 100L recommended)
- Bio S – nitrifying bacteria for accelerating the nitrogen cycle (1 drop/100L daily for 14 days, then at every water change or filter media replacement)
- AF Life Source – natural biodiversity booster (10ml/100L weekly)
- Aquaforest NO3 & PO4 Premium Test Kits to monitor water parameters

**Step-by-step application:**
1. **Aquascape:** Use Stone Fix to assemble AF Rock into a stable structure with ample water circulation and hiding spots for livestock. Dry fully before placement in the tank.
2. **Prepare saltwater:** Dissolve Aquaforest salt in RO/DI water at 25°C. Stir until clear and slowly fill the aquarium.
3. **Add sand:** Prepare AF Bio Sand according to instructions (mix with water, let sit 24h at 25–28°C), then add gradually to the tank.
4. **Install filtration media:** Place Life Bio Fil in a high-flow area or media reactor for best performance.
5. **Introduce bacteria:** Dose 1 drop Bio S per 100L daily for 14 days, plus 10ml AF Life Source per 100L weekly for enhanced biodiversity.
6. **Monitor parameters:** Use NO3 & PO4 test kits to track the nitrogen cycle. Wait for NH4 and NO2 to drop to zero before introducing livestock.
7. **Control temperature:** Keep the tank at 29–30°C for the first 2–3 weeks to accelerate cycling, then lower to 25°C before stocking corals and fish.

**Why choose the Kickstart Method?** It prevents parameter instability and ugly-phase issues, shortens maturation time, and creates a robust, resilient reef environment. Unlike mixing brands, using live rock, or transferring water from other tanks (which can introduce pests or disrupt the cycle), this method uses only Aquaforest products designed to work together, ensuring repeatable results. 

**Results:** Faster ecosystem development, stable water chemistry, and an ideal foundation for corals and fish. This approach is tested, effective, and trusted by advanced aquarists and beginners alike. Start your marine aquarium the right way—with the Aquaforest Kickstart Method—and enjoy a beautiful, thriving reef sooner than ever.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Aquaforest’s improved aquarium salt marks a new standard in quality, purity, and consistency for marine hobbyists. Years of research and development have produced a formula tailored to the precise demands of modern reefkeeping. **Advanced production technology** ensures every batch is homogeneously blended, with parameters stable and repeatable from bag to bag. The company’s switch to smaller, optimized batch sizes gives unmatched quality control, minimizing the risk of uneven mixes and guaranteeing identical results for every aquarist.

**Purity of ingredients** is now at its highest level: all raw materials are chosen only from trusted, certified suppliers, and are further purified before mixing. This attention to sourcing translates to better water quality, less contamination risk, and an ideal habitat for sensitive marine organisms, including corals and invertebrates.

**Quality control** is the core of the new formula. Each ingredient is individually tested before production, and the salt mixture is monitored at every stage. Internal quality standards exceed industry and supplier benchmarks – every batch undergoes comprehensive testing: solubility, clarity, pH, kH, organic content, and advanced analysis using ICP-OES with two independent, calibrated spectrometers. Full test results are posted online for every production batch, giving customers full transparency.

**Lowered iron content** – based on direct customer feedback – means the salt is less likely to cause unwanted residue, reducing deposits in brine, and supports improved chemical balance in the aquarium. The macro- and microelement ratios have also been adjusted to better reflect the needs of marine life, supporting stable biological function, vibrant coloration, and coral health.

**Why choose the new Aquaforest salt?** The product delivers consistent results, highest possible purity, and constant innovation in response to user needs. Benefits include:
- Repeatable, stable parameters in every bag
- Premium, certified, and purified raw materials
- Continuous improvements from customer input
- Full quality control at every stage of manufacture
- Publicly available batch testing for transparency
- Optimal micro- and macronutrient content for demanding marine organisms
- Field-proven performance: tested in Aquaforest’s own display tanks and by top aquarists

With the new formula, Aquaforest continues its commitment to meeting the highest standards in marine aquaristics. Whether you’re running a reef tank or a fish-only marine aquarium, this salt provides the foundation for healthy, stable, and visually stunning aquatic life.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>
