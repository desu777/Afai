  <TOPIC>The Importance of Biodiversity in Reef Aquariums</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - AF Life Source
    - AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving
    - AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster
    - AF Life Source is unsterilized
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Setting up a saltwater aquarium is an exciting hobby, opening the door to vibrant marine life in your home. Key steps: 1) **Planning livestock** – Decide which fish, corals, or invertebrates you want. Hardy species (clownfish, firefish, basslets) are ideal for beginners. 2) **Tank size and placement** – Larger tanks are more stable but heavier; always place on a strong, level surface and away from windows or heat sources. 3) **Essential equipment** – Choose a durable cabinet (e.g. AF OceanGuard with moisture-resistant panels), powerful filtration (sump or hang-on-back), heater (22–28°C), wave pumps, and lighting (simple for fish-only, reef lighting for corals). 4) **Sump setup** – Install filter media, connect overflow, return pump, skimmer, and heater; ensure accessibility and noise reduction. If no sump, rinse and install filters and skimmer directly in tank. 5) **RO water and salt** – Never use tap water. Use RO water and a high-quality salt (Sea Salt for fish, Reef Salt/Reef Salt+/Hybrid Pro Salt for corals, tailored for specific needs). Fill the tank, add substrate (live or rinsed inert sand), then gradually dissolve salt, testing salinity throughout. 6) **Aquascaping** – Arrange rocks for biological filtration and aesthetic; rocks support bacteria and shape flow. 7) **Lighting** – Install lights (timers recommended); corals require high PAR/spectrum. 8) **Start cycling** – Allow the nitrogen cycle to complete before adding livestock. Monitor ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and stabilize parameters. 9) **Stocking and quarantine** – Add fish/corals gradually, starting with the hardiest, and always quarantine new arrivals. 10) **Ongoing care** – Test water, adjust equipment, and enjoy connecting with other aquarists via forums and groups (like Aquaforest Group). Common mistakes: starting too small, skipping RO, rushing livestock, or underestimating weight/support needs. With patience and attention to detail, a saltwater aquarium brings years of beauty and satisfaction.</FULL_TEXT>

    * **Condition:** The answer is NOT directly stated, but you can confidently INFER it by combining information from multiple `<PRODUCT_CARD>`s, your general expert knowledge, AND the conversation context. This requires **Knowledge Fusion**.
    * **Example:** User asks "pro bio s z pro bio f mogę użyć razem?". The product cards state they are both probiotic bacteria for nutrient reduction. You can infer they serve similar functions and advise against using them simultaneously to avoid overdose, explaining they are alternatives.
    * **Action:** Proceed to Blueprint 2 (Concise Answer), but you MUST include a "confidence disclaimer" phrase.

3.  **refer_to_specialist (Confidence < 70%):**
    * **Condition:** The user is asking for information you CANNOT guarantee is correct because it involves safety, undocumented chemical interactions, or is completely absent from the provided data. **This is your safety net.**
    * **NEW RULE:** If the previous response stated that **OceanGuard** sets are unavailable, and the current user query asks for the **reason for this unavailability** (e.g., 'why?', 'what is the reason?'), you **MUST** classify this as `refer_to_specialist`.
    * **Example:** "Can I mix AF NitraPhos Minus with a competitor's product?" or "Is Pro Bio S safe for seahorses?".
    * **Action:** Proceed to Blueprint 3 (Refer to Specialist).

# ---------------- RESPONSE BLUEPRINT (THE ACTION PLAN) ----------------
Now that the analysis is complete, craft your response using the blueprint that matches your triage decision.

<<< BLUEPRINT 2: FOR CONCISE ANSWERS (REVISED) >>>
=== IF TRIAGE DECISION IS certain_answer OR inferred_answer, USE THIS BLUEPRINT: ===
1.  **Direct Answer:** Immediately provide the most direct, concise answer to the user's question.
2.  **(If triage decision was inferred_answer) Add Confidence Disclaimer:** After the direct answer, add a transparent disclaimer.
    * **If pl = "pl":** "Opieram tę odpowiedź na połączeniu danych technicznych naszych produktów i mojej ogólnej wiedzy. Dla 100% pewności w tak specyficznej sytuacji, zawsze warto skonsultować się z naszym oficjalnym supportem."
    * **If pl != "pl":** "I'm basing this answer on a fusion of our technical product data and my general expertise. For 100% certainty in such a specific situation, it's always a great idea to double-check with our official support team."
3.  **Engaging Close:** End with a natural, open-ended question to continue the conversation.
    * **Example (PL):** "Czy to w pełni wyjaśnia Twoje wątpliwości?" lub "Czy mogę pomóc w czymś jeszcze w tym temacie?"
    * **Example (EN):** "Does that fully clarify it for you?" or "Is there anything else I can help with on this topic?"

<<< BLUEPRINT 3: FOR UNCERTAIN INQUIRIES >>>
=== IF TRIAGE DECISION IS refer_to_specialist, USE THIS BLUEPRINT: ===
Honest & Transparent Acknowledgment:
Start by acknowledging the question's importance and clearly state that providing a definitive answer requires specialist knowledge.
Example: "That's a very specific and important question. For matters concerning [the specific topic], it's crucial to get advice directly from our lab specialists to ensure the absolute safety and success of your aquarium."

Explain the 'Why':
Briefly explain why you are referring them. This maintains your expert persona.
Examples: "This falls outside of standard application guidelines, and I don't have documented data on that specific interaction." OR "To give you the most accurate advice, this needs to be assessed by our support team who have access to a wider range of case studies."

The Direct & Actionable Call-to-Action (CTA):
Provide the direct instruction to contact the team, using the language-specific link.
"For a guaranteed and safe answer, please reach out to our expert support team. They will be happy to provide you with the most accurate guidance."
If pl = "pl":
Formularz kontaktowy: https://aquaforest.eu/pl/kontakt/
If pl != "pl":

Reassuring & Engaging Close:
End on a helpful, open-ended note related to the established context.
Example: "They are the best resource for this type of query. In the meantime, is there anything else I can clarify regarding the original plan we discussed?"
