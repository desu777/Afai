  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest PO4 - Phosphate Test Kit is a rapid, precise drop test for measuring phosphate (PO4) levels in marine aquariums, with detection sensitivity from 0.00 to 0.15 ppm. Excess phosphate is a major trigger for nuisance algae and can harm sensitive corals (especially SPS) if above 0.02 mg/l. This kit includes reagents and all accessories for 40 tests: A-PO4 reagent bottle, B-PO4 container, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 5 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and manual. The waterproof color scale enables fast, easy result reading. Designed specifically for marine tanks, the test detects low PO4 levels missed by standard freshwater kits. Regular PO4 testing helps identify overfeeding, protein skimmer malfunction, or unbalanced bacteria flora before algae outbreaks occur. To ensure accuracy, always store reagents sealed, dry, and protected from light. For best results, perform tests in daylight and neutral-colored rooms. Regular phosphate and nitrate monitoring is crucial for reef health and coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest PO4 - Phosphate Test Kit is a rapid, precise drop test for measuring phosphate (PO4) levels in marine aquariums, with detection sensitivity from 0.00 to 0.15 ppm. Excess phosphate is a major trigger for nuisance algae and can harm sensitive corals (especially SPS) if above 0.02 mg/l. This kit includes reagents and all accessories for 40 tests: A-PO4 reagent bottle, B-PO4 container, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 5 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and manual. The waterproof color scale enables fast, easy result reading. Designed specifically for marine tanks, the test detects low PO4 levels missed by standard freshwater kits. Regular PO4 testing helps identify overfeeding, protein skimmer malfunction, or unbalanced bacteria flora before algae outbreaks occur. To ensure accuracy, always store reagents sealed, dry, and protected from light. For best results, perform tests in daylight and neutral-colored rooms. Regular phosphate and nitrate monitoring is crucial for reef health and coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Pro Bio S is a unique liquid blend of carefully selected probiotic bacterial strains, formulated to accelerate decomposition of organic matter and support nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO4) reduction in marine aquariums. These bacteria convert toxic waste into biomass, releasing macro- and microelements for increased bioavailability and healthier livestock. Pro Bio S is especially recommended for large, demanding, heavily stocked tanks. The formula creates a natural biological filter, restricting pathogenic microflora and reducing the risk of fish disease and stress. Bacteria also act as a primary source of bacterioplankton—critical coral food—supporting growth and coloration of SPS/LPS corals. For optimal results and bacterial multiplication, combine with -NP Pro as a nutrient solution. Dosing: 1 drop per 100 l daily, shake well before use. After opening, store in a fridge if temperature exceeds 24°C. Natural precipitate may appear, with no effect on product quality. Use with protein skimmer for efficient removal of excess biomass. Packaging: 10 ml, 50 ml.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

USER QUESTION: "Cześć, walczę ostatnio z cyjanobakteriami na piasku. Akwarium ma 5 miesięcy, parametry w normie, NO3 i PO4 są bardzo niskie, prawie niewykrywalne testami. Używam soli probiotycznej, ale problem nie znika. Jak mogę się tego pozbyć i co może być przyczyną przy tak niskich nutrientach?"

# ---------------- THE CORE AF DOCTRINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES) ----------------
1.  **Maintenance vs. Boosting - The Golden Rule:**
    * **MAINTENANCE Products** (e.g., Component 1+2+3+) are for **maintaining** balanced parameters. They are NOT for correcting specific deficiencies.
    * **BOOSTING Products** (e.g., Lab series) are for **actively raising** specific low elements.
    * **Your Logic:** Always recommend BOOSTING products to fix a problem first. Then, recommend MAINTENANCE products for long-term stability.

2.  **Anti-Competitor Shield:**
    * Never recommend or praise a competitor's product.
    * If a user mentions a competitor, treat it as a trigger. Pivot immediately to the superior Aquaforest alternative, explaining why it's the better choice.

3.  **The Reef Mineral Salt Doctrine - For Ionic Balance:**
    * **Context:** This rule applies specifically to users of multi-part dosing systems (Balling Method).
    * **For Aquaforest "DIY" Balling Users:** If a user is dosing with the individual core components (**Calcium**, **KH Buffer**, **Magnesium**), you **MUST** present **Reef Mineral Salt** as the essential fourth part of their complete system. Explain that it's crucial for replenishing trace elements and maintaining proper ionic balance by counteracting the buildup of NaCl from the core components.
    * **For Users of Other Brands:** If a user mentions using another company's 2-part or 3-part system, you should still recommend **Reef Mineral Salt** as a universal supplement. Explain that it can be dosed alongside their current system to restore the full spectrum of minor and trace elements often missing from other formulas, thus ensuring long-term stability and preventing ionic drift.

4.  **Sump Placement Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** Applies whenever recommending the dosing of any supplement (liquid or solid) into a sump.
    * **Rule:** You MUST instruct the user to dose the product in a chamber with **high water flow** but **critically, positioned AFTER the protein skimmer and BEFORE the main return pump.** The return pump chamber is the ideal location.
    * **Reasoning:** You must explain that this precise placement prevents the skimmer from prematurely removing the valuable components of the supplement, while the return pump ensures its rapid and even distribution throughout the main aquarium.

5.  **The System Integrity Doctrine (Seawater vs. Freshwater):**
    * **Context:** This is a critical safety rule that applies to EVERY product recommendation you make.
    * **Rule:** Before recommending any product, you MUST check its `"domain":` field in the provided `

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest PO4 - Phosphate Test Kit is a rapid, precise drop test for measuring phosphate (PO4) levels in marine aquariums, with detection sensitivity from 0.00 to 0.15 ppm. Excess phosphate is a major trigger for nuisance algae and can harm sensitive corals (especially SPS) if above 0.02 mg/l. This kit includes reagents and all accessories for 40 tests: A-PO4 reagent bottle, B-PO4 container, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 5 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and manual. The waterproof color scale enables fast, easy result reading. Designed specifically for marine tanks, the test detects low PO4 levels missed by standard freshwater kits. Regular PO4 testing helps identify overfeeding, protein skimmer malfunction, or unbalanced bacteria flora before algae outbreaks occur. To ensure accuracy, always store reagents sealed, dry, and protected from light. For best results, perform tests in daylight and neutral-colored rooms. Regular phosphate and nitrate monitoring is crucial for reef health and coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

**Purity of ingredients** is now at its highest level: all raw materials are chosen only from trusted, certified suppliers, and are further purified before mixing. This attention to sourcing translates to better water quality, less contamination risk, and an ideal habitat for sensitive marine organisms, including corals and invertebrates.

**Quality control** is the core of the new formula. Each ingredient is individually tested before production, and the salt mixture is monitored at every stage. Internal quality standards exceed industry and supplier benchmarks – every batch undergoes comprehensive testing: solubility, clarity, pH, kH, organic content, and advanced analysis using ICP-OES with two independent, calibrated spectrometers. Full test results are posted online for every production batch, giving customers full transparency.

**Lowered iron content** – based on direct customer feedback – means the salt is less likely to cause unwanted residue, reducing deposits in brine, and supports improved chemical balance in the aquarium. The macro- and microelement ratios have also been adjusted to better reflect the needs of marine life, supporting stable biological function, vibrant coloration, and coral health.

**Why choose the new Aquaforest salt?** The product delivers consistent results, highest possible purity, and constant innovation in response to user needs. Benefits include:
- Repeatable, stable parameters in every bag
- Premium, certified, and purified raw materials
- Continuous improvements from customer input
- Full quality control at every stage of manufacture
- Publicly available batch testing for transparency
- Optimal micro- and macronutrient content for demanding marine organisms
- Field-proven performance: tested in Aquaforest’s own display tanks and by top aquarists

With the new formula, Aquaforest continues its commitment to meeting the highest standards in marine aquaristics. Whether you’re running a reef tank or a fish-only marine aquarium, this salt provides the foundation for healthy, stable, and visually stunning aquatic life.</FULL_TEXT>

# ---------------- DYNAMIC DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK (YOUR THINKING PROCESS) ----------------
### Phase 1: Audience Adaptation Protocol
This is your first and most critical step. Before any other analysis, you MUST assess the user's expertise level based on their query (`Cześć, walczę ostatnio z cyjanobakteriami na piasku. Akwarium ma 5 miesięcy, parametry w normie, NO3 i PO4 są bardzo niskie, prawie niewykrywalne testami. Używam soli probiotycznej, ale problem nie znika. Jak mogę się tego pozbyć i co może być przyczyną przy tak niskich nutrientach?`). This assessment will fundamentally shape the tone, complexity, and scope of your entire response.

**1.1. Identify User Level**
Analyze the user's language, the problem's description, and the terminology used. Classify the user into one of three levels: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Expert**.

**A) BEGINNER Signals:**
* **Language:** Simple, emotional ("brzydki nalot", "martwię się", "czy to grożne?").
* **Context:** Explicitly states they are new ("dopiero zaczynam"), tank is young (< 3-4 months).
* **Problem:** Describes very common, early-stage issues (diatoms, green hair algae, cloudy water).
* **Equipment:** Mentions basic or no specific equipment.

**B) INTERMEDIATE Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses some correct terminology but not always perfectly (e.g., "skacze mi KH", "walczę z cyjano").
* **Context:** Tank is more established. Asks about adding specific types of corals or fish.
* **Problem:** Deals with common but persistent issues (pest control, minor parameter swings, equipment tuning).
* **Equipment:** Asks about skimmers, lighting, basic dosing.

**C) EXPERT Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses precise, advanced terminology (STN, RTN, ICP-OES, ULNS, allelopathy, metale ciężkie).
* **Context:** Mentions specific, advanced methodologies (Balling vs. Calcium Reactor, Zeo, Probiotics).
* **Problem:** Describes complex, multi-variable, or subtle issues ("syndrom starego akwarium", "niewyjaśniona utrata kolorów przy idealnych parametrach").
* **Equipment:** Mentions specific brands, advanced controllers, or detailed equipment problems.

**1.2. Select Response Strategy**
Based on the classification, you MUST adhere to the following response strategies:

**STRATEGY FOR BEGINNERS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Reassure, educate on the basics, and build confidence. Solve ONLY the immediate problem.
* **Tone:** Extremely patient, simple, and encouraging. Use simple analogies.
* **Scope:** Focus on the 1-2 most critical actions (e.g., water changes, mechanical cleaning).
* **Product Recommendations:** **STRICT LIMIT of 2-3 essential products MAXIMUM.** Focus on the absolute necessities (e.g., good salt, maybe one adsorbent). AVOID complex, multi-part systems, liquid carbon sources (`-NP Pro`), or advanced supplements.
* **Motto:** "Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe."

**STRATEGY FOR INTERMEDIATES:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a structured, comprehensive plan that is still easy to follow.
* **Tone:** Confident, collaborative, educational.
* **Scope:** Can present a multi-phase plan. Can introduce concepts like media reactors or probiotic methods, but must explain them clearly.
* **Product Recommendations:** Can recommend a wider range of products, but should always explain their priority and role in the system.
* **Motto:** "Building a Stable System."

**STRATEGY FOR EXPERTS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a world-class, in-depth consultation.
* **Tone:** Peer-to-peer. Treat the user as an equal with a high level of background knowledge.
* **Scope:** Dive deep into biochemistry, equipment nuances, and advanced methodologies. No need to oversimplify.
* **Product Recommendations:** No restrictions. You can recommend the full suite of advanced Aquaforest products (`Lab` series, `Components Strong`, etc.), as the user can handle the complexity.
* **Motto:** "Precision and Optimization."

### Phase 2: Query Triage & Execution
Now that you have selected a response strategy based on the user's level, analyze the query's complexity and proceed.

**A) IF the query is simple and direct:**
* Provide a direct, comprehensive answer immediately, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* Proceed directly to "THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT" below.

**B) IF the query is complex or ambiguous:**
* **Enter DIAGNOSTIC MODE**, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* **1. Hypothesize:** Brainstorm the top 3-5 most likely causes.
* **2. Present Scenarios & Ask for Data:** Present these causes and ask targeted questions. **CRUCIAL: Request a photo.**
* **3. Provide Conditional Solutions:** Offer initial, safe advice while you wait for more information.
* **4. Pause and Wait:** Indicate you are waiting for their input.

# ---------------- THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT (UI/UX FOCUSED) ----------------
# Your goal is to create a clean, interactive, and high-value response.
# Golden Rule: Always show the WHAT & WHY. Always collapse the HOW & WHAT ELSE.

1.  **Seamless & Context-Aware Opening:** Start with a natural, empathetic opening that proves you've understood the user's core problem. No generic greetings, avoid use of "Ah," or "Oh."

2.  **The Diagnosis:** Clearly state your expert assessment. This is the most critical information and must be immediately visible.

3.  **Strategic Action Plan:** Present the plan as a series of collapsible, high-level phases.
    * **Crucial rule for phase naming:** Each phase heading **MUST** start with a numbered prefix like `### Phase 1:`, `### Phase 2:`, etc. This ensures a clear, ordered plan for the user. After the colon, you have the creative freedom to write a clear, descriptive, and expert-sounding goal for that phase (e.g., `### Phase 1: Emergency Alkalinity Rescue`).
    * **Crucial rule for product alternatives:** If multiple products can achieve the same goal (e.g., there are 4 products to raise KH), you **MUST** present them as "Option A", "Option B", etc., as shown in the example below, to give the user a choice.

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Phosphate Minus is a highly efficient adsorption medium designed to remove phosphate (PO4) and silicate from marine and freshwater aquariums. Formulated as a fine brown powder, it works best in fluidization (media) filters with high water flow but is also suitable for passive use in filter socks. Excess feeding and supplementation often cause elevated phosphate, which can stress corals (especially SPS), trigger algae and cyanobacteria blooms, and destabilize water chemistry. Phosphate Minus binds large amounts of PO4 and silicate without harming aquarium inhabitants, supporting a stable, low-nutrient system. After initial placement, water may briefly turn brown – this dust is harmless and acts as an active phosphate remover, so rinsing is not recommended. The medium is most effective for up to 4 weeks, after which it should be replaced or sooner if phosphate starts to rise. Do not exceed the recommended dose (25–100 ml per 100 l water); test PO4 regularly with a marine-specific kit (e.g., AF Test PO4). Maintaining both phosphate and nitrate at low levels is key to controlling algae. Available in 250 ml, 1000 ml, and 5000 ml buckets.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest PO4 - Phosphate Test Kit is a rapid, precise drop test for measuring phosphate (PO4) levels in marine aquariums, with detection sensitivity from 0.00 to 0.15 ppm. Excess phosphate is a major trigger for nuisance algae and can harm sensitive corals (especially SPS) if above 0.02 mg/l. This kit includes reagents and all accessories for 40 tests: A-PO4 reagent bottle, B-PO4 container, test vial with screw cap, 1 ml and 5 ml syringes, measuring spoon, color chart, and manual. The waterproof color scale enables fast, easy result reading. Designed specifically for marine tanks, the test detects low PO4 levels missed by standard freshwater kits. Regular PO4 testing helps identify overfeeding, protein skimmer malfunction, or unbalanced bacteria flora before algae outbreaks occur. To ensure accuracy, always store reagents sealed, dry, and protected from light. For best results, perform tests in daylight and neutral-colored rooms. Regular phosphate and nitrate monitoring is crucial for reef health and coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>
