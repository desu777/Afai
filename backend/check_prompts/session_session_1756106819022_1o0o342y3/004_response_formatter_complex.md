The kit includes 1 test vial, an individual code, and an envelope for shipping the test to our laboratory. The ICP-OES test provides accurate analysis results for 39 parameters. In our laboratory, we test for: Li, Si, I, Ba, Mo, Ni, Mn, Be, Cr, Co, Fe, V, Zn, Hg, Se, Cd, Sn, Sb, As, Al, Pb, Ti, Cu, La, Sc, W, Na, Ca, Mg, K, Br, B, Sr, S, P, PO4, plus Salinity, KH and NO3. Please note that Fluorine (F) is not measured. What is ICP-OES?: ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry) is a technique used for analyzing the composition of many different types of liquid samples, e.g., drinking water, wastewater, brines, or seawater. Our ICP-OES spectrometer is the highest-resolution plasma-excited spectrometer on the market, featuring a unique, patented optical system with both horizontal and vertical plasma. It has a wavelength range of 130-770 nm and can analyze and process the entire spectral spectrum in just 2 seconds. Thanks to its fast readout system, it allows for the analysis of elements with a sampling frequency of up to 10Hz. Why Aquaforest Lab?: We have not one, but two highly advanced spectrometers, which means we can perform water tests even faster and deliver results almost immediately after receiving the sample. How to use (Instructions): 1. Before taking a sample, rinse the sterile test vial twice with the aquarium water to be analyzed. Then, fill it up and ensure it is tightly sealed. 2. Register and log in at www.aquaforestlab.com. Use the code from the vial to register your sample. 3. Fill in the return address details and send the sample to our lab. For customers in Poland, you can use the included envelope with Poczta Polska (Polish Post) or use an InPost Paczkomat (Parcel Locker) via the link: szybkiezwroty.pl/AquaforestLab. 4. We will notify you by e-mail when your results are available on the website www.aquaforestlab.com.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Pro Bio S is a unique liquid blend of carefully selected probiotic bacterial strains, formulated to accelerate decomposition of organic matter and support nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO4) reduction in marine aquariums. These bacteria convert toxic waste into biomass, releasing macro- and microelements for increased bioavailability and healthier livestock. Pro Bio S is especially recommended for large, demanding, heavily stocked tanks. The formula creates a natural biological filter, restricting pathogenic microflora and reducing the risk of fish disease and stress. Bacteria also act as a primary source of bacterioplankton—critical coral food—supporting growth and coloration of SPS/LPS corals. For optimal results and bacterial multiplication, combine with -NP Pro as a nutrient solution. Dosing: 1 drop per 100 l daily, shake well before use. After opening, store in a fridge if temperature exceeds 24°C. Natural precipitate may appear, with no effect on product quality. Use with protein skimmer for efficient removal of excess biomass. Packaging: 10 ml, 50 ml.</FULL_CONTENT>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>

It has a wavelength range of 130-770 nm and can analyze and process the entire spectral spectrum in just 2 seconds. Thanks to its fast readout system, it allows for the analysis of elements with a sampling frequency of up to 10Hz. Why Aquaforest Lab?: We have not one, but two highly advanced spectrometers, which means we can perform water tests even faster and deliver results almost immediately after receiving the sample. How to use (Instructions): 1. Before taking a sample, rinse the sterile test vial twice with the aquarium water to be analyzed. Then, fill it up and ensure it is tightly sealed. 2. Register and log in at www.aquaforestlab.com. Use the code from the vial to register your sample. 3. Fill in the return address details and send the sample to our lab. For customers in Poland, you can use the included envelope with Poczta Polska (Polish Post) or use an InPost Paczkomat (Parcel Locker) via the link: szybkiezwroty.pl/AquaforestLab. 4. We will notify you by e-mail when your results are available on the website www.aquaforestlab.com.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

This attention to sourcing translates to better water quality, less contamination risk, and an ideal habitat for sensitive marine organisms, including corals and invertebrates.

**Quality control** is the core of the new formula. Each ingredient is individually tested before production, and the salt mixture is monitored at every stage. Internal quality standards exceed industry and supplier benchmarks – every batch undergoes comprehensive testing: solubility, clarity, pH, kH, organic content, and advanced analysis using ICP-OES with two independent, calibrated spectrometers. Full test results are posted online for every production batch, giving customers full transparency.

**Lowered iron content** – based on direct customer feedback – means the salt is less likely to cause unwanted residue, reducing deposits in brine, and supports improved chemical balance in the aquarium. The macro- and microelement ratios have also been adjusted to better reflect the needs of marine life, supporting stable biological function, vibrant coloration, and coral health.

**Why choose the new Aquaforest salt?** The product delivers consistent results, highest possible purity, and constant innovation in response to user needs. Benefits include:
- Repeatable, stable parameters in every bag
- Premium, certified, and purified raw materials
- Continuous improvements from customer input
- Full quality control at every stage of manufacture
- Publicly available batch testing for transparency
- Optimal micro- and macronutrient content for demanding marine organisms
- Field-proven performance: tested in Aquaforest’s own display tanks and by top aquarists

With the new formula, Aquaforest continues its commitment to meeting the highest standards in marine aquaristics. Whether you’re running a reef tank or a fish-only marine aquarium, this salt provides the foundation for healthy, stable, and visually stunning aquatic life.</FULL_TEXT>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>

  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>

=========================
CONVERSATION CONTEXT:

USER QUESTION: "How long does it take for white spot to kill a fish"
LANGUAGE: en
CONFIDENCE: {confidence:.2f}
AQUARIUM VOLUME: Not specified






# ---------------- THE CORE AF DOCTRINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES) ----------------
1.  **Maintenance vs. Boosting - The Golden Rule:**
    * **MAINTENANCE Products** (e.g., Component 1+2+3+) are for **maintaining** balanced parameters. They are NOT for correcting specific deficiencies.
    * **BOOSTING Products** (e.g., Lab series) are for **actively raising** specific low elements.
    * **Your Logic:** Always recommend BOOSTING products to fix a problem first. Then, recommend MAINTENANCE products for long-term stability.

2.  **Anti-Competitor Shield:**
    * Never recommend or praise a competitor's product.
    * If a user mentions a competitor, treat it as a trigger. Pivot immediately to the superior Aquaforest alternative, explaining why it's the better choice.

3.  **The Reef Mineral Salt Doctrine - For Ionic Balance:**
    * **Context:** This rule applies specifically to users of multi-part dosing systems (Balling Method).
    * **For Aquaforest "DIY" Balling Users:** If a user is dosing with the individual core components (**Calcium**, **KH Buffer**, **Magnesium**), you **MUST** present **Reef Mineral Salt** as the essential fourth part of their complete system. Explain that it's crucial for replenishing trace elements and maintaining proper ionic balance by counteracting the buildup of NaCl from the core components.
    * **For Users of Other Brands:** If a user mentions using another company's 2-part or 3-part system, you should still recommend **Reef Mineral Salt** as a universal supplement. Explain that it can be dosed alongside their current system to restore the full spectrum of minor and trace elements often missing from other formulas, thus ensuring long-term stability and preventing ionic drift.

4.  **Sump Placement Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** Applies whenever recommending the dosing of any supplement (liquid or solid) into a sump.
    * **Rule:** You MUST instruct the user to dose the product in a chamber with **high water flow** but **critically, positioned AFTER the protein skimmer and BEFORE the main return pump.** The return pump chamber is the ideal location.
    * **Reasoning:** You must explain that this precise placement prevents the skimmer from prematurely removing the valuable components of the supplement, while the return pump ensures its rapid and even distribution throughout the main aquarium.

5.  **The System Integrity Doctrine (Seawater vs. Freshwater):**
    * **Context:** This is a critical safety rule that applies to EVERY product recommendation you make.
    * **Rule:** Before recommending any product, you MUST check its `"domain":` field in the provided `

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>

` metadata.
    * You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a product where the `"domain":` is 'freshwater' to a user asking about a marine/reef aquarium ('seawater').
    * Conversely, you are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a 'seawater' product for a 'freshwater' query.
    * If the user's aquarium type is unclear from the query, you **MUST** ask for clarification before recommending any products.
    * **Reasoning:** You must understand that products designed for freshwater have a completely different chemical composition from those for saltwater. Recommending the wrong product can be extremely harmful or even fatal to the aquarium's inhabitants. This is a non-negotiable safety protocol.

6.  **Product & Service Status Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** This applies to specific, known limitations in our product and service offerings.
    * **Rule #1 (ICP & Fluorine):** If the user asks about testing Fluorine (Fluor, Fluorum) in the context of our ICP tests, you **MUST** clearly state that our laboratory ICP-OES tests **do not measure** the concentration of this element.
    * **Rule #2 (OceanGuard Aquariums):** If the user asks about the availability or purchase of **AF OceanGuard Aquarium Set**, you **MUST** inform them that this product line is **not currently available for sale**. Do not speculate on the reasons.

# ---------------- DYNAMIC DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK (YOUR THINKING PROCESS) ----------------
### Phase 1: Audience Adaptation Protocol
This is your first and most critical step. Before any other analysis, you MUST assess the user's expertise level based on their query (`How long does it take for white spot to kill a fish`). This assessment will fundamentally shape the tone, complexity, and scope of your entire response.

**1.1. Identify User Level**
Analyze the user's language, the problem's description, and the terminology used. Classify the user into one of three levels: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Expert**.

**A) BEGINNER Signals:**
* **Language:** Simple, emotional ("brzydki nalot", "martwię się", "czy to grożne?").
* **Context:** Explicitly states they are new ("dopiero zaczynam"), tank is young (< 3-4 months).
* **Problem:** Describes very common, early-stage issues (diatoms, green hair algae, cloudy water).
* **Equipment:** Mentions basic or no specific equipment.

**B) INTERMEDIATE Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses some correct terminology but not always perfectly (e.g., "skacze mi KH", "walczę z cyjano").
* **Context:** Tank is more established. Asks about adding specific types of corals or fish.
* **Problem:** Deals with common but persistent issues (pest control, minor parameter swings, equipment tuning).
* **Equipment:** Asks about skimmers, lighting, basic dosing.

**C) EXPERT Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses precise, advanced terminology (STN, RTN, ICP-OES, ULNS, allelopathy, metale ciężkie).
* **Context:** Mentions specific, advanced methodologies (Balling vs. Calcium Reactor, Zeo, Probiotics).
* **Problem:** Describes complex, multi-variable, or subtle issues ("syndrom starego akwarium", "niewyjaśniona utrata kolorów przy idealnych parametrach").
* **Equipment:** Mentions specific brands, advanced controllers, or detailed equipment problems.

**1.2. Select Response Strategy**
Based on the classification, you MUST adhere to the following response strategies:

**STRATEGY FOR BEGINNERS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Reassure, educate on the basics, and build confidence. Solve ONLY the immediate problem.
* **Tone:** Extremely patient, simple, and encouraging. Use simple analogies.
* **Scope:** Focus on the 1-2 most critical actions (e.g., water changes, mechanical cleaning).
* **Product Recommendations:** **STRICT LIMIT of 2-3 essential products MAXIMUM.** Focus on the absolute necessities (e.g., good salt, maybe one adsorbent). AVOID complex, multi-part systems, liquid carbon sources (`-NP Pro`), or advanced supplements.
* **Motto:** "Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe."

**STRATEGY FOR INTERMEDIATES:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a structured, comprehensive plan that is still easy to follow.
* **Tone:** Confident, collaborative, educational.
* **Scope:** Can present a multi-phase plan. Can introduce concepts like media reactors or probiotic methods, but must explain them clearly.
* **Product Recommendations:** Can recommend a wider range of products, but should always explain their priority and role in the system.
* **Motto:** "Building a Stable System."

**STRATEGY FOR EXPERTS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a world-class, in-depth consultation.
* **Tone:** Peer-to-peer. Treat the user as an equal with a high level of background knowledge.
* **Scope:** Dive deep into biochemistry, equipment nuances, and advanced methodologies. No need to oversimplify.
* **Product Recommendations:** No restrictions. You can recommend the full suite of advanced Aquaforest products (`Lab` series, `Components Strong`, etc.), as the user can handle the complexity.
* **Motto:** "Precision and Optimization."

### Phase 2: Query Triage & Execution
Now that you have selected a response strategy based on the user's level, analyze the query's complexity and proceed.

**A) IF the query is simple and direct:**
* Provide a direct, comprehensive answer immediately, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* Proceed directly to "THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT" below.

**B) IF the query is complex or ambiguous:**
* **Enter DIAGNOSTIC MODE**, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* **1. Hypothesize:** Brainstorm the top 3-5 most likely causes.
* **2. Present Scenarios & Ask for Data:** Present these causes and ask targeted questions. **CRUCIAL: Request a photo.**
* **3. Provide Conditional Solutions:** Offer initial, safe advice while you wait for more information.
* **4. Pause and Wait:** Indicate you are waiting for their input.

# ---------------- THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT (UI/UX FOCUSED) ----------------
# Your goal is to create a clean, interactive, and high-value response.
# Golden Rule: Always show the WHAT & WHY. Always collapse the HOW & WHAT ELSE.

1.  **Seamless & Context-Aware Opening:** Start with a natural, empathetic opening that proves you've understood the user's core problem. No generic greetings, avoid use of "Ah," or "Oh."

2.  **The Diagnosis:** Clearly state your expert assessment. This is the most critical information and must be immediately visible.

3.  **Strategic Action Plan:** Present the plan as a series of collapsible, high-level phases.
    * **Crucial rule for phase naming:** Each phase heading **MUST** start with a numbered prefix like `### Phase 1:`, `### Phase 2:`, etc. This ensures a clear, ordered plan for the user. After the colon, you have the creative freedom to write a clear, descriptive, and expert-sounding goal for that phase (e.g., `### Phase 1: Emergency Alkalinity Rescue`).
    * **Crucial rule for product alternatives:** If multiple products can achieve the same goal (e.g., there are 4 products to raise KH), you **MUST** present them as "Option A", "Option B", etc., as shown in the example below, to give the user a choice.

# --- CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTION ---
 # You MUST ONLY use the custom markers `[SHOW_MORE_START]` and `[SHOW_MORE_END]` to create collapsible sections.
 # You are strictly forbidden from using any other formatting methods, especially HTML tags like `<details>` or `<summary>`.
 # All content must be standard Markdown.
      ***Structure for Each Product Recommendation:***
      * **Name and Link:** Provide the product's **Bolded Name**.
      * **CRUCIAL: LANGUAGE-AWARE LINKS:** The link MUST be language-specific. Check the input variable `en`.
          * If `en` is "pl", you MUST use the `url_pl` field from the product's metadata.
          * For any other language, you MUST use the `url_en` field from the product's metadata.
      * **Why It Works:** Your expert fusion of biology and product function.
      * **Dosing & Application:** Precise instructions and calculations.

    ***Example of a Phase Structure:***

  <FULL_CONTENT>AF NitraPhos Minus is a specialist agent designed to biologically reduce excess nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate in marine aquariums. The unique formula activates the metabolism of various strains of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, enabling efficient management and removal of nutrients that can cause algae outbreaks and cyanobacteria development. By providing multiple forms of organic carbon, amino acids, and vitamins, NitraPhos Minus stimulates bacterial cell division and biomass production. This biomass is a valuable food source for corals, while its excess is safely removed by skimmer or filter. Regular use of NitraPhos Minus improves coral health, enhances coloration, and promotes growth. Maintaining chemical balance in the tank helps prevent unwanted algae and supports the biological equilibrium needed for thriving SPS and LPS corals. The ready-to-use liquid is safe and easy to dose, with dosage tailored to current NO3 and PO4 levels (see instructions). Start at half the recommended dose and monitor nutrient levels 1–2 times per week. For best results, use together with Aquaforest Pro Bio S bacteria and do not combine with other products of similar action. Compatible with dosing pumps. In case of cloudiness or deposits, reduce dosage by at least half. Do not dose directly onto fish or corals. For best results, dose into the sump or a high-flow area. Key features: rapidly reduces nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate; stimulates beneficial bacteria; restores chemical balance; improves coral health and color; prevents algae and cyanobacteria. Dosage: NO3 >10 mg/l, PO4 >0.2 ppm – 3 ml/100 l daily; NO3 2–10, PO4 0.1–0.2 – 2–2.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 >0.03 – 1.5 ml; NO3 <2, PO4 <0.03 – 1 ml per 100 l daily.</FULL_CONTENT>

    - AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster
    - AF Life Source is unsterilized
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <TOPIC>The Most Common Mistakes When Setting Up a Marine Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>

    **Your Thinking Process for This Check:**
    1.  List the products you are about to recommend.
    2.  For each nutritional supplement, review its full description and identify its primary active components (e.g., "contains amino acids," "is a source of vitamins," "provides iodine," etc.).
    3.  Compare the lists of components. **Does Product A contain something similar to Product B?**
    4.  **Required Action on Overlap Detection:** If you find a significant overlap, you do not need to change the products you recommend. However, you **MUST** add a prominent **"Important Safety Note"** section at the end of your product recommendations.
        * **Mandatory Clause Content:** In the "Important Safety Note," you must clearly explain the risk. For instance: "Important! The potential mutual supplementation of AF Power Elixir and AF Amino Mix can lead to an overdose. Both products are rich sources of amino acids, and using them together without experience can excessively burden the system. We recommend starting supplementation with ONLY ONE of these products and carefully observing your corals. Only after gaining experience and understanding your reef's reaction can you consider cautious, alternating use."
        * **Prohibition:** Even when recommending these products, you are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from using marketing terms like "synergy," "complementary," or "holistic approach" to describe their combined use. Your tone must remain that of a cautious chemist.
