  <FULL_CONTENT>KH Plus is a highly concentrated liquid agent designed to quickly raise carbonate hardness (KH) in marine aquariums. It is formulated to manage sudden drops in alkalinity, eliminate deficits, and restore ionic balance—essential for the healthy development and calcification of corals, mollusks, and calcifying algae. Stable KH levels (recommended: 6.5–8.5 dKH) support strong coral skeleton formation and help maintain stable pH, which reduces the toxicity of metabolic by-products and aids the absorption of calcium. The formula is of laboratory purity, contains no dyes or preservatives, and is safe for all marine organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of KH Plus increases KH by 0.5 dKH in 100 l of water. Maximum daily dose: 10 ml/100 l (do not raise more than 0.5 dKH per 24 hours). If a higher increase is needed, split the dose over several days. Always verify that magnesium levels are within range before adjusting calcium or KH. To avoid precipitation, never dose KH Plus and Ca Plus at the same time; leave a time gap for full dissolution. Dose directly into an area of strong water flow. KH Plus is suitable for all reef aquariums, including tanks with demanding SPS and LPS corals, snails, clams, and crabs.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Product Description: Component 1+2+3+ is the key to balanced microelement dosing for marine aquariums. The chemical formula is based on the H. Balling method but has been modified and enriched with essential trace elements. This creates three fluids that, when dosed regularly in equal quantities, meet the coral's demand not only for magnesium and calcium but for all elements whose dosage is otherwise difficult to determine. Product Features: The formula is based on years of experience, providing an ideal ratio of macro and microelements in perfectly balanced fluids that meet all aquarium needs. It ensures proper ionic balance thanks to the inclusion of Reef Mineral Salt. Component Breakdown: Component 1+ contains: Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr, Mo (25ml raises Ca by 4.5 ppm/100L). Component 2+ contains: NaHCO3, F, I (25ml raises KH by 0.65 dKH, which is Alk 0.23 meq/100L). Component 3+ contains: Mg, mineral salts, K, B, Li (25ml raises Mg by 0.38 ppm/100L). Component 3+ contains Reef Mineral Salt, which is essential for stabilizing aquarium parameters. Dosing Instructions: We recommend dosing all liquids in equal amounts, adjusted based on coral consumption and regular water tests (Calcium, Magnesium, KH). For a moderately stocked tank, the daily dose is approx. 25 ml per 100 liters of water for each component. To maintain stable parameters, we recommend dividing the daily dose into as many small doses as possible. If the consumption of one element is higher, we recommend supplementing it with a separate solution (Calcium, Magnesium, or KH Buffer) until the parameters are balanced. Why is Ionic Balance So Important? The Role of NaCl-Free Salt: The NaCl-free salt used in Component 3+ is seawater with sodium chloride removed. It contains all other essential components like Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium, Bromine, Fluorine, Barium, Iodine, and other trace elements. Its primary role is not just to replenish trace elements, but to maintain the correct ratios of all salts in the seawater, adhering to the Dittmar Principle, which states that the main components of seawater have a constant ratio. When dosing calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to provide building blocks for coral skeletons (CaCO3), a byproduct is created: sodium chloride (NaCl), as shown in the reaction: CaCl2 + 2NaHCO3 => CaCO3 + 2NaCl + H2O + CO2. This excess NaCl disrupts the natural ionic composition of the water. Water changes are often insufficient to correct this imbalance, as a 100% water change would be needed. Neglecting the NaCl-free salt solution, as is common in simplified Balling methods, leads to a gradual depletion of trace elements and an ionic imbalance masked by stable salinity readings generated by excess NaCl. The original, complete Balling method, which includes this third component, is more effective and leads to fewer long-term stability problems.</FULL_CONTENT>
