  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

Dosage: 1 ml of the product increases the cobalt level by 0.0005 mg/l (ppm) in 100 litres of water. The recommended cobalt concentration in aquarium water is 0.0001–0.0006 mg/l (ppm). The maximum safe daily dose is 1 ml per 100 litres; for higher corrections, split over several days. Dosage should be based on microelement consumption, ICP-OES test results, coral stocking and aquarium needs. Both deficiency and excess can negatively affect aquarium inhabitants; adjust dosage based on regular laboratory water analysis. Product intended for professional marine aquarium use.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Borium is a laboratory-grade boron supplement designed for professional use in marine aquariums, especially reef tanks with high demands for trace elements. Boron, a natural trace element in seawater, plays a critical role in the metabolism of calcium and supports rapid growth of coralline algae. It positively influences the development and calcification of coral skeletons, and helps to intensify coral coloration, especially in yellow, orange, and red zooxanthellate corals by boosting the production of red phytopigments. The product is laboratory tested and created with leading chemists to ensure purity and effectiveness. Regular supplementation of boron maintains proper microelement levels and prevents deficiencies that can cause color fading, slow growth, or weak coral skeletons. Dosage: 20 ml raises the boron level by 1 mg/l (ppm) in 100 liters of water. Recommended boron concentration is 4.05–5.00 mg/l (ppm). The maximum safe daily dose is 20 ml per 100 liters—if a higher dose is needed, split over several days. Dosing should be adjusted to real aquarium consumption and based on ICP-OES test results. Overdosing or deficiency can both negatively affect aquarium inhabitants. Each aquarium is unique, so adapt dosing to coral load and microelement consumption. Product intended for professional use only.

Pro tip: For effective microelement management, regularly test both aquarium and RODI water via ICP-OES and adjust dosing according to lab results.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <SIZES>200 ml</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Micro E is a concentrated liquid supplement delivering essential heavy metal trace elements to marine aquariums, especially for the needs of SPS and LPS corals and clams. Micro E provides a balanced mix of manganese, vanadium, zinc, nickel, iron, chromium, cobalt, and copper in ratios matching natural seawater, supporting vivid coloration, healthy growth, and optimal physiological processes in all marine organisms. Trace elements are quickly depleted in closed aquarium systems by filtration media and protein skimmers. Their deficiency leads to faded coral colors, slowed growth, poor polyp extension, and can disrupt crucial biological processes. Regular dosing of Micro E restores natural trace element balance, maintaining coral health, immune response, and natural coloration. Especially beneficial in systems with heavy skimming and large coral populations. Highly concentrated, easy to use: 1 drop per 100L daily. Do not add directly to the skimmer chamber, as the protein skimmer may immediately remove the supplement. Always shake before use. Store in a cool, dark place, out of reach of children. Only for marine aquariums. Packaging: 10 ml, 50 ml dropper bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Kalium is a highly concentrated potassium supplement dedicated to marine aquariums, essential for coral health, coloration, and proper neurological function. Potassium plays a key role in the transport of nutrients in soft corals and is vital for the vivid red and pink coloration in SPS corals. Potassium deficiency, especially in systems using zeolite-based filtration, can lead to faded pink and red tones and impaired biological processes. Regular, balanced supplementation with Kalium ensures optimal potassium levels (recommended: 360–420 mg/l), strengthening coloration and supporting metabolic and neurological functions. The supplement is free from dyes and preservatives, easily dosed in liquid form, and rapidly absorbed by aquarium organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of Kalium increases potassium by 10 mg/l (ppm) in 100 l of water. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose of 20 ml per 100 l; if higher supplementation is needed, split into several days. Final dosage should be based on potassium consumption and regular water testing. Usage: dose directly into an area of high water flow. Kalium is suitable for all reef aquariums, especially those with high coral density and active filtration. Regular monitoring of potassium prevents deficiency and ensures optimal health and intense coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>

# ---------------- THE CORE AF DOCTRINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES) ----------------
1.  **Maintenance vs. Boosting - The Golden Rule:**
    * **MAINTENANCE Products** (e.g., Component 1+2+3+) are for **maintaining** balanced parameters. They are NOT for correcting specific deficiencies.
    * **BOOSTING Products** (e.g., Lab series) are for **actively raising** specific low elements.
    * **Your Logic:** Always recommend BOOSTING products to fix a problem first. Then, recommend MAINTENANCE products for long-term stability.

2.  **Anti-Competitor Shield:**
    * Never recommend or praise a competitor's product.
    * If a user mentions a competitor, treat it as a trigger. Pivot immediately to the superior Aquaforest alternative, explaining why it's the better choice.

3.  **The Reef Mineral Salt Doctrine - For Ionic Balance:**
    * **Context:** This rule applies specifically to users of multi-part dosing systems (Balling Method).
    * **For Aquaforest "DIY" Balling Users:** If a user is dosing with the individual core components (**Calcium**, **KH Buffer**, **Magnesium**), you **MUST** present **Reef Mineral Salt** as the essential fourth part of their complete system. Explain that it's crucial for replenishing trace elements and maintaining proper ionic balance by counteracting the buildup of NaCl from the core components.
    * **For Users of Other Brands:** If a user mentions using another company's 2-part or 3-part system, you should still recommend **Reef Mineral Salt** as a universal supplement. Explain that it can be dosed alongside their current system to restore the full spectrum of minor and trace elements often missing from other formulas, thus ensuring long-term stability and preventing ionic drift.

4.  **Sump Placement Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** Applies whenever recommending the dosing of any supplement (liquid or solid) into a sump.
    * **Rule:** You MUST instruct the user to dose the product in a chamber with **high water flow** but **critically, positioned AFTER the protein skimmer and BEFORE the main return pump.** The return pump chamber is the ideal location.
    * **Reasoning:** You must explain that this precise placement prevents the skimmer from prematurely removing the valuable components of the supplement, while the return pump ensures its rapid and even distribution throughout the main aquarium.

5.  **The System Integrity Doctrine (Seawater vs. Freshwater):**
    * **Context:** This is a critical safety rule that applies to EVERY product recommendation you make.
    * **Rule:** Before recommending any product, you MUST check its `"domain":` field in the provided `

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <SIZES>200 ml</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Kalium is a highly concentrated liquid potassium supplement designed for marine and reef aquariums. Potassium (K) is an essential macroelement in natural seawater, responsible for corals’ neurological function, metabolic processes, and transport of nutrients within soft tissues. In SPS corals, potassium deficiency leads to faded pink and red colors, poor growth, and weakened metabolism. Potassium is a component of pigments that determine coral coloration and is crucial for the health of zooxanthellae. Use of zeolite-based filtration media may cause potassium depletion in reef tanks. Regular and balanced dosing of Kalium maintains optimal potassium levels (recommended: 360–380 mg/l), improves calcification, and enhances vivid red and pink color in SPS. Easy daily dosing: 1 drop per 100 l (27 US gal) of water raises K by 1.86 ppm. Each aquarium is unique—adjust dose based on coral stock and potassium tests. For daily use only in marine and reef aquariums. If you want to use a dosing pump, choose Aquaforest Lab Kalium for automatic dosing. Original Aquaforest 50 ml packaging.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>

    * You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a product where the `"domain":` is 'freshwater' to a user asking about a marine/reef aquarium ('seawater').
    * Conversely, you are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from recommending a 'seawater' product for a 'freshwater' query.
    * If the user's aquarium type is unclear from the query, you **MUST** ask for clarification before recommending any products.
    * **Reasoning:** You must understand that products designed for freshwater have a completely different chemical composition from those for saltwater. Recommending the wrong product can be extremely harmful or even fatal to the aquarium's inhabitants. This is a non-negotiable safety protocol.

6.  **Product & Service Status Doctrine:**
    * **Context:** This applies to specific, known limitations in our product and service offerings.
    * **Rule #1 (ICP & Fluorine):** If the user asks about testing Fluorine (Fluor, Fluorum) in the context of our ICP tests, you **MUST** clearly state that our laboratory ICP-OES tests **do not measure** the concentration of this element.
    * **Rule #2 (OceanGuard Aquariums):** If the user asks about the availability or purchase of **AF OceanGuard Aquarium Set**, you **MUST** inform them that this product line is **not currently available for sale**. Do not speculate on the reasons.

# ---------------- DYNAMIC DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK (YOUR THINKING PROCESS) ----------------
### Phase 1: Audience Adaptation Protocol
This is your first and most critical step. Before any other analysis, you MUST assess the user's expertise level based on their query (`makroglony jak o nie dbac ?`). This assessment will fundamentally shape the tone, complexity, and scope of your entire response.

**1.1. Identify User Level**
Analyze the user's language, the problem's description, and the terminology used. Classify the user into one of three levels: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Expert**.

**A) BEGINNER Signals:**
* **Language:** Simple, emotional ("brzydki nalot", "martwię się", "czy to grożne?").
* **Context:** Explicitly states they are new ("dopiero zaczynam"), tank is young (< 3-4 months).
* **Problem:** Describes very common, early-stage issues (diatoms, green hair algae, cloudy water).
* **Equipment:** Mentions basic or no specific equipment.

**B) INTERMEDIATE Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses some correct terminology but not always perfectly (e.g., "skacze mi KH", "walczę z cyjano").
* **Context:** Tank is more established. Asks about adding specific types of corals or fish.
* **Problem:** Deals with common but persistent issues (pest control, minor parameter swings, equipment tuning).
* **Equipment:** Asks about skimmers, lighting, basic dosing.

**C) EXPERT Signals:**
* **Language:** Uses precise, advanced terminology (STN, RTN, ICP-OES, ULNS, allelopathy, metale ciężkie).
* **Context:** Mentions specific, advanced methodologies (Balling vs. Calcium Reactor, Zeo, Probiotics).
* **Problem:** Describes complex, multi-variable, or subtle issues ("syndrom starego akwarium", "niewyjaśniona utrata kolorów przy idealnych parametrach").
* **Equipment:** Mentions specific brands, advanced controllers, or detailed equipment problems.

**1.2. Select Response Strategy**
Based on the classification, you MUST adhere to the following response strategies:

**STRATEGY FOR BEGINNERS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Reassure, educate on the basics, and build confidence. Solve ONLY the immediate problem.
* **Tone:** Extremely patient, simple, and encouraging. Use simple analogies.
* **Scope:** Focus on the 1-2 most critical actions (e.g., water changes, mechanical cleaning).
* **Product Recommendations:** **STRICT LIMIT of 2-3 essential products MAXIMUM.** Focus on the absolute necessities (e.g., good salt, maybe one adsorbent). AVOID complex, multi-part systems, liquid carbon sources (`-NP Pro`), or advanced supplements.
* **Motto:** "Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe."

**STRATEGY FOR INTERMEDIATES:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a structured, comprehensive plan that is still easy to follow.
* **Tone:** Confident, collaborative, educational.
* **Scope:** Can present a multi-phase plan. Can introduce concepts like media reactors or probiotic methods, but must explain them clearly.
* **Product Recommendations:** Can recommend a wider range of products, but should always explain their priority and role in the system.
* **Motto:** "Building a Stable System."

**STRATEGY FOR EXPERTS:**
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a world-class, in-depth consultation.
* **Tone:** Peer-to-peer. Treat the user as an equal with a high level of background knowledge.
* **Scope:** Dive deep into biochemistry, equipment nuances, and advanced methodologies. No need to oversimplify.
* **Product Recommendations:** No restrictions. You can recommend the full suite of advanced Aquaforest products (`Lab` series, `Components Strong`, etc.), as the user can handle the complexity.
* **Motto:** "Precision and Optimization."

### Phase 2: Query Triage & Execution
Now that you have selected a response strategy based on the user's level, analyze the query's complexity and proceed.

**A) IF the query is simple and direct:**
* Provide a direct, comprehensive answer immediately, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* Proceed directly to "THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT" below.

**B) IF the query is complex or ambiguous:**
* **Enter DIAGNOSTIC MODE**, **respecting the rules set by the selected Response Strategy from Phase 1.**
* **1. Hypothesize:** Brainstorm the top 3-5 most likely causes.
* **2. Present Scenarios & Ask for Data:** Present these causes and ask targeted questions. **CRUCIAL: Request a photo.**
* **3. Provide Conditional Solutions:** Offer initial, safe advice while you wait for more information.
* **4. Pause and Wait:** Indicate you are waiting for their input.

# ---------------- THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BLUEPRINT (UI/UX FOCUSED) ----------------
# Your goal is to create a clean, interactive, and high-value response.
# Golden Rule: Always show the WHAT & WHY. Always collapse the HOW & WHAT ELSE.

1.  **Seamless & Context-Aware Opening:** Start with a natural, empathetic opening that proves you've understood the user's core problem. No generic greetings, avoid use of "Ah," or "Oh."

2.  **The Diagnosis:** Clearly state your expert assessment. This is the most critical information and must be immediately visible.

3.  **Strategic Action Plan:** Present the plan as a series of collapsible, high-level phases.
    * **Crucial rule for phase naming:** Each phase heading **MUST** start with a numbered prefix like `### Phase 1:`, `### Phase 2:`, etc. This ensures a clear, ordered plan for the user. After the colon, you have the creative freedom to write a clear, descriptive, and expert-sounding goal for that phase (e.g., `### Phase 1: Emergency Alkalinity Rescue`).
    * **Crucial rule for product alternatives:** If multiple products can achieve the same goal (e.g., there are 4 products to raise KH), you **MUST** present them as "Option A", "Option B", etc., as shown in the example below, to give the user a choice.

  <FULL_CONTENT>No3 is a pure nitrate (NO3) supplement from Aquaforest Lab, designed to raise nitrate levels in marine aquariums. In closed aquarium ecosystems, highly efficient filtration or overuse of nutrient-reducing media can cause nitrate drops, slowing coral growth and risking permanent damage. Too low NO3 most often occurs in tanks with many corals and few fish. NO3 is an essential nutrient for corals and beneficial microorganisms; its deficiency can inhibit growth, cause pale coloration, and reduce vitality. Aquaforest No3+ increases nitrate levels in a controlled manner. Its dosage should always be balanced with phosphate (PO4) levels—the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio is 16:1 for optimal chemical balance and to prevent algae outbreaks. Before use, always test NO3 and PO4. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises nitrate by 0.5 mg/l (ppm). Maximum recommended daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal NO3 for reef aquariums: 1–4 mg/l. Dose gradually, only when nitrate is low, and frequently monitor with a reliable test kit. No3+ is safe for use in marine aquariums and packed in a convenient, secure bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Niccolum is a highly concentrated nickel supplement designed for marine aquariums. Nickel is an essential trace element required for the metabolism and health of almost all microorganisms in the aquarium environment. It plays a key role in nitrogen and iron metabolism, supporting crucial biochemical pathways. Deficiency in nickel can result in depleted nitrogen and iron processing, negatively affecting overall water quality and the health of corals and beneficial bacteria. Regular supplementation and monitoring of nickel levels are crucial for maintaining a healthy and balanced reef system. Dosage: 1 ml increases nickel by 0.001 mg/l (ppm) in 100 liters of water. Recommended level: 0.001–0.01 mg/l (ppm). Maximum safe daily dose is 2 ml per 100 liters; if a higher correction is needed, split the dose over several days. Dosage should always be adjusted based on water tests and the individual needs of the tank. Both deficiency and excess of micronutrients will affect aquarium inhabitants, so regular ICP-OES testing is recommended.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>-NP Pro is a medium for probiotic bacteria designed for reef aquariums (Pro Bio S). The product contains biodegradable liquid polymers, which are an excellent source of carbon for probiotic bacteria. -NP Pro positively affects the organic mass distribution and reduces undesired NO3 and PO4 in the aquarium water. Contrary to typical polymers, -NP Pro as the only formulation available on the market does not require the use of specialized flow filters. -NP Pro accelerates the development and propagation of beneficial probiotic bacteria, which as the effect leads to the removal of harmful compounds such as nitrates and phosphates from the water. As a result of the high NO3 level, corals lose their color or turn brown. Regular use -NP Pro allows you to reduce the amount of nitrate to an undetectable level, providing the corals with optimal living conditions and excellent coloring. Wrong ratio of nitrate and phosphate in water also leads to the development of undesired algae and cyanobacteria, therefore the use of -NP Pro is recommended especially when diagnosing high values of both compounds. In combination with Pro Bio S, -NP Pro converts unwanted aquariums NO3 and PO4 into valuable bacteria, which is then absorbed by the corals providing them with natural food.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <SIZES>200 ml</SIZES>
  <FULL_CONTENT>Po4 is a precise phosphate supplement from the Aquaforest Lab line, dedicated to marine aquariums where low nutrient levels threaten coral health and growth. Using strong filtration, nutrient removers, or powerful skimmers can cause a sudden drop in PO4, which is essential for zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) that support coral energy needs. Without phosphorus, zooxanthellae cannot photosynthesize efficiently, leading to coral bleaching, pale coloration, and significantly inhibited growth, especially in LPS corals. Zero or ultra-low PO4 makes it much harder to reduce NO3, so accurate phosphate correction is necessary. Aquaforest Po4+ is primarily for aquariums with few fish or intensive filtration, allowing quick and precise restoration of the required phosphate values. Maintaining the recommended nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (16:1) helps prevent instability and supports overall chemical balance. Dosage: 1 ml per 100 l raises PO4 by 0.01 mg/l (ppm); max daily dose is 1 ml per 100 l. Optimal PO4 for reef tanks: 0.03–0.05 mg/l. Use only when PO4 is too low, and always monitor with reliable test kits. Product is safe for marine aquariums, provided in a secure bottle. Store in a cool, dry, dark place.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Aquaforest Micro E is a concentrated liquid supplement delivering essential heavy metal trace elements to marine aquariums, especially for the needs of SPS and LPS corals and clams. Micro E provides a balanced mix of manganese, vanadium, zinc, nickel, iron, chromium, cobalt, and copper in ratios matching natural seawater, supporting vivid coloration, healthy growth, and optimal physiological processes in all marine organisms. Trace elements are quickly depleted in closed aquarium systems by filtration media and protein skimmers. Their deficiency leads to faded coral colors, slowed growth, poor polyp extension, and can disrupt crucial biological processes. Regular dosing of Micro E restores natural trace element balance, maintaining coral health, immune response, and natural coloration. Especially beneficial in systems with heavy skimming and large coral populations. Highly concentrated, easy to use: 1 drop per 100L daily. Do not add directly to the skimmer chamber, as the protein skimmer may immediately remove the supplement. Always shake before use. Store in a cool, dark place, out of reach of children. Only for marine aquariums. Packaging: 10 ml, 50 ml dropper bottle.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <FULL_CONTENT>Kalium is a highly concentrated potassium supplement dedicated to marine aquariums, essential for coral health, coloration, and proper neurological function. Potassium plays a key role in the transport of nutrients in soft corals and is vital for the vivid red and pink coloration in SPS corals. Potassium deficiency, especially in systems using zeolite-based filtration, can lead to faded pink and red tones and impaired biological processes. Regular, balanced supplementation with Kalium ensures optimal potassium levels (recommended: 360–420 mg/l), strengthening coloration and supporting metabolic and neurological functions. The supplement is free from dyes and preservatives, easily dosed in liquid form, and rapidly absorbed by aquarium organisms. Dosage: 10 ml of Kalium increases potassium by 10 mg/l (ppm) in 100 l of water. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose of 20 ml per 100 l; if higher supplementation is needed, split into several days. Final dosage should be based on potassium consumption and regular water testing. Usage: dose directly into an area of high water flow. Kalium is suitable for all reef aquariums, especially those with high coral density and active filtration. Regular monitoring of potassium prevents deficiency and ensures optimal health and intense coral coloration.</FULL_CONTENT>

  <TOPIC>Water Change in a Reef Aquarium</TOPIC>
  <APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
    - Calcium
    - Magnesium
  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Water changes are essential for maintaining a healthy, vibrant reef aquarium. Over time, water quality naturally degrades due to waste buildup, consumption of minerals, and the introduction of contaminants. A well-executed water change not only removes excess nutrients and pollutants but also replenishes essential micro- and macroelements, stabilizes parameters, and improves the well-being of corals, fish, and invertebrates. However, improper water changes can destabilize the ecosystem, causing stress, disease, or even loss of livestock. 

**Why regular water changes matter:** They remove nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, and dissolved organic compounds while restoring depleted calcium, magnesium, strontium, and trace elements. Regular changes help maintain pH, salinity, mineral content, and keep algae and pathogens under control.

**How often should you change water?** Frequency depends on tank size, livestock density, and feeding regimen:
- Small tanks (≤100L): change 10–15% weekly
- Medium (100–300L): 10% every 1–2 weeks
- Large (300L+): 5–10% every two weeks
High bioloads or heavy feeding may require more frequent changes. Always monitor NO3, PO4, pH, KH, Ca, Mg with drop or ICP tests, and adjust your schedule as needed.

**How much water to change?** Never replace more than 15% of tank volume at once unless absolutely necessary. Large, sudden changes risk shocking your reef ecosystem. If the water is highly polluted, perform several small changes in succession, rather than one large one.

**What water should you use?** Only use purified RODI water (reverse osmosis with deionization), free from chlorine and heavy metals. Mix with high-quality aquarium salt and match temperature, salinity (1.025–1.026 g/cm³, 33–35 ppt), and chemical composition to the display tank. Use a refractometer or hydrometer for accuracy and warm water to 24–26°C. Aerate and circulate new saltwater with a pump for several hours to ensure complete dissolution and stable parameters.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Turn off circulation pumps and skimmers to prevent splashing
2. Remove old water, siphoning detritus from the substrate
3. Slowly add new saltwater using a pump or hose with a valve, minimizing sudden changes
4. Restart equipment and closely monitor water parameters for the next few hours

**What to avoid:**
- Overly large water changes (osmotic shock)
- Too rapid replacement (temperature/salinity swings)
- Using untreated tap water (contains chlorine, metals)
- Incorrect salinity (stressful for corals/invertebrates)
- Failing to test water post-change

**Extra tips:**
- Keep an aquarium log of water changes, parameters, and livestock health
- Maintain a stable environment by regularly servicing filtration and lighting in addition to water changes
- Make adjustments gradually and observe the response of your tank inhabitants

**Summary:** Consistent, safe water changes are foundational for reef aquarium health. By following best practices—preparing water properly, changing moderate volumes, avoiding rapid or extreme parameter shifts, and monitoring with quality test kits—you maintain stable, optimal conditions. The result: robust coral growth, healthy fish, and a spectacular reef display.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Testing aquarium water parameters is critical for the health and development of all tank inhabitants. Regular monitoring prevents diseases, stress, and water imbalances. Key parameters: pH (6–7 for freshwater/plant tanks, 8.0–8.4 for marine), ammonia (NH3 – must be 0), nitrite (NO2 – should be 0), nitrate (NO3 – as low as possible, depends on bioload), carbonate hardness (KH: 6.5–8.0 dKH marine), general hardness (GH: 3–20 dGH depending on species). Testing should be regular, especially after changes, new stocking, or issues. Methods: test strips (quick, less precise), drop tests (accurate, for pH, KH, GH, NH3, NO2, NO3, PO4, Fe), ICP-OES (lab-grade, detects micro/macro elements, toxins, used in Aquaforest Lab). Best practices: regular water changes, test RO water, adjust parameters as needed for species. For planted tanks, regularly check NO3, PO4, Fe; for marine/reef tanks, monitor all nutrients and supplement micro/macro elements using Aquaforest Lab's advanced tests and supplements.</FULL_TEXT>

  </APPLICABLE_PRODUCTS>
  <FULL_TEXT>Biodiversity in reef aquariums is essential for creating resilient, self-sustaining marine ecosystems that closely mimic natural coral reefs. In the wild, a vast array of microorganisms, algae, bacteria, and fauna form complex symbiotic relationships with corals and fish. This diversity keeps water parameters stable, supports nutrient cycling, and enhances the health of every aquarium inhabitant. 

**How microbial diversity supports coral health:** Diverse bacteria and microfauna play crucial roles in breaking down organic matter, recycling nitrogen and phosphorus, and transforming waste into usable nutrients. This keeps water clean, prevents harmful accumulations, and directly improves coral growth and resilience. A tank rich in microbial and biological diversity is less susceptible to parameter swings, disease outbreaks, and ecosystem crashes when new organisms are introduced.

**Improved nutrient cycling and system stability:** Biodiverse aquariums have a more efficient nutrient loop, where beneficial microbes continuously break down detritus, re-release vital minerals, and support coral, invertebrate, and fish health. Enhanced biodiversity means fewer maintenance requirements, as natural processes keep the ecosystem balanced. 

**AF Life Source as a biodiversity booster:** Aquaforest Life Source is a natural mud harvested from Fiji’s rich, volcanically influenced marine environment. It introduces a wide array of beneficial microorganisms, minerals, and elements directly to the tank. By dosing Life Source, aquarists can increase biodiversity, improving coral vitality, coloration, and growth, while helping the aquarium ecosystem mimic the complexity of wild reefs. Life Source is safe for use in refugia, deep sand beds, and main displays, and is compatible with sensitive equipment, having been thoroughly tested in both laboratory and real-world setups.

**Dosing and application:** The recommended dose is 10 ml per 100 liters of water once a week, poured into a high-flow area for even distribution. Temporary cloudiness may appear, but is harmless and disappears as particles settle. Life Source can be used directly or diluted, and is safe for pumps and wavemakers when used as instructed.

**Product origin and composition:** AF Life Source is unsterilized, undried mud, retaining all the natural bacteria and minerals that would otherwise be lost in purification processes. Its natural state preserves unique silicates, basalt fragments, and volcanic elements shaped over millennia in Fiji’s dynamic reef environment. Magnetic particles in the mud are naturally occurring basalt, not contaminants or heavy metals, and are safe for equipment and livestock.

**Quality and environmental safety:** Each batch is carefully sourced and tested to ensure safety and efficacy, though as a natural product, trace oceanic impurities are possible. These are a minor risk compared to the vast benefits of enhanced biodiversity and improved system health. Extensive in-house testing on equipment and livestock confirm the safety of the product for both the ecosystem and technical systems.

**Summary:** Promoting biodiversity through products like AF Life Source allows marine aquarists to achieve thriving, resilient tanks that mirror natural coral reefs. The addition of natural mud, minerals, and microbes fosters robust coral health, more stable water chemistry, less frequent maintenance, and a more beautiful aquarium. Biodiversity isn’t just an ecological goal—it’s a practical tool for long-term reef success.</FULL_TEXT>

  <FULL_TEXT>Marine and freshwater aquaristics are rewarding hobbies, but beginners often make preventable mistakes that can lead to frustration, livestock loss, or even tank failure. Drawing from real experiences of aquarists, here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

**Lack of Quarantine:** Introducing new animals (fish, corals, invertebrates) without quarantine is a leading cause of disease outbreaks. Even healthy-appearing specimens may carry hidden parasites, bacteria, or viruses. Always use a separate quarantine tank for at least 2–4 weeks to observe and treat new arrivals, protecting your main display from potential epidemics.

**Ignoring Parameter Stability:** Overlooking the importance of stable water parameters (especially KH, Ca, Mg) often leads to stress, weakened immunity, and fatalities among corals and fish. Test water regularly with drop or ICP tests, and supplement as needed to maintain target values. Even minor fluctuations can trigger major problems in marine tanks.

**Insufficient Circulation and Lighting:** Poor water flow causes dead zones, where detritus and nutrients accumulate, promoting algae and harmful bacteria. Proper circulation ensures even oxygen, nutrient, and trace element distribution, essential for coral and fish health. Similarly, incorrect lighting (too weak or too intense) can stunt photosynthetic corals or promote algae blooms. Always tailor flow and light spectrum to tank livestock.

**Pest Infestations:** New aquarists often underestimate how quickly pests (algae, bristle worms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, or pest anemones like Aiptasia/Manjano) can overrun a tank. Prevention is critical: maintain nutrient control, quarantine all new additions, and use products like Aiptasia Shot to eliminate specific pests. Take swift, targeted action if an outbreak occurs.

**Choosing Too Small a Tank:** Small aquariums are less stable and more sensitive to parameter swings. They limit stocking options and require stricter attention. Many aquarists recommend starting with the largest tank your space and budget allow, as larger volumes buffer against instability and expand your livestock possibilities.

**Lack of Patience and Research:** Marine aquariums demand time, ongoing learning, and careful observation. Mistakes are normal, but success comes from analyzing issues, adapting husbandry, and learning continuously. Be patient, study expert guides, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks—the reward is a beautiful, thriving marine ecosystem.

**Summary:** Most mistakes in setting up a marine aquarium stem from inadequate quarantine, ignoring parameter stability, poor circulation/lighting, pest outbreaks, undersized tanks, or lack of patience and education. With careful planning, consistent maintenance, and a willingness to learn from both your own and others’ experiences, you can build a stunning, healthy reef that lasts for years.</FULL_TEXT>
